#!Whether you're frustrated with current PC offerings (and their inflated prices) or are simply looking for a cool project to take on, building a computer from the ground up using off-the-shelf parts can offer significant advantages. In these pages, computer dudes Darrel Wayne Creacy and Carlito Vicencio outline those advantages and then show you how to build the computer of your dreams. The pair begins by explaining what components make up a PC and what you need to think about when selecting those components, before helping you determine your needs and suggesting various configurations to fit those uses. Breaking the process down into its simplest terms, the authors provide component lists for a number of different PC setups: for students, home users, multimedia/home-theater enthusiasts, high-end graphic/video/audio producers, and more. Using plain language and plenty of visual and instructional aids--photos, illustrations, diagrams, step-by-step directions, and more--the authors ensure that even someone (like you!) who knows nothing about technology can build the perfect PC! On a more personal note, the authors are donating a percentage of their income from this book to the Breast Cancer Research Foundationï¾to thank all the women in their lives who have supported them and battled the disease.

#!Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Neyman-Pearson lemma are two fundamental concepts in statistics. Both are about likelihood ratios: Kullback-Leibler divergence is the expected log-likelihood ratio, and the Neyman-Pearson lemma is about error rates of likelihood ratio tests. Exploring this connection gives another statistical interpretation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms of the loss of power of the likelihood ratio test when the wrong distribution is used for one of the hypotheses. In this interpretation, the standard non-negativity property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is essentially a restatement of the optimal property of likelihood ratios established by the Neyman-Pearson lemma. The asymmetry of Kullback-Leibler divergence is overviewed in information geometry.

#!Motivation: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. Results: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis---TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. Availability: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL).

#!We consider a problem motivated by the desire to provide flexible, rate-based, quality of service guarantees for packets sent over input queued switches and switch networks. Our focus is solving a type of online traffic scheduling problem, whose input at each time step is a set of desired traffic rates through the switch network. These traffic rates in general cannot be exactly achieved since they assume arbitrarily small fractions of packets can be transmitted at each time step. The goal of the traffic scheduling problem is to closely approximate the given sequence of traffic rates by a sequence of transmissions in which only whole packets are sent. We prove worst-case bounds on the additional buffer use, which we call backlog, that results from using such an approximation.We first consider the N × N, input queued, crossbar switch. Our main result is an online packet-scheduling algorithm using no speedup that guarantees backlog at most (N+1)2/4 packets at each input port and each output port. Upper bounds on worst-case backlog have been proved for the case of constant fluid schedules, such as the N2-2N+2 bound of Chang, Chen, and Huang (INFOCOM, 2000). Our main result for the crossbar switch is the first, to our knowledge, to bound backlog in terms of switch size N for arbitrary, time-varying fluid schedules, without using speedup.Our main result for Banyan networks is an exact characterization of the speedup required to maintain bounded backlog, in terms of polytopes derived from the network topology.

#!The field of supply chain management has been growing at a rapid pace in recent years, both as a research area and as a practical discipline. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of product covering problems in 3-tier supply chain models, and present natural complete problems for the classes W[3] and W[4] in parameterized complexity theory. This seems the first group of natural complete problems for higher levels in the parameterized intractability hierarchy (i.e., the W-hierarchy), and the first precise complexity characterizations of certain optimization problems in the research of supply chain management. Our results also derive strong computational lower bounds and inapproximability for these optimization problems.

#!To simulate adaptive agents with abilities matching those of their real-world counterparts, a natural approach is to incorporate adaptation mechanisms such as classical conditioning into agent-based simulation. Existing models for adaptation mechanisms are usually based on quantitative methods such as DST. In contrast, agent-based simulation is usually based on qualitative, logical languages. To bridge this gap, this paper puts forward an integrative approach to simulate and analyse the conditioning process of an adaptive agent, which integrates quantitative and qualitative aspects within one temporal specification language. The approach comprises (1) simulation of adaptation mechanisms in an executable language, (2) automated analysis of dynamic properties against simulation traces, and (3) verification of representation relations for internal agent states against simulation traces. Furthermore, the approach addresses the issue of realism of intermediate states in a simulated conditioning process.

#!The polynomial classifier (PC) that takes the binomial terms of reduced subspace features as inputs has shown superior performance to multilayer neural networks in pattern classification. In this paper, we propose a class-specific feature polynomial classifier (CFPC) that extracts class-specific features from class-specific subspaces, unlike the ordinary PC that uses a class-independent subspace. The CFPC can be viewed as a hybrid of ordinary PC and projection distance method. The class-specific features better separate one class from the others, and the incorporation of class-specific projection distance further improves the separability. The connecting weights of CFPC are efficiently learned class-by-class to minimize the mean square error on training samples. To justify the promise of CFPC, we have conducted experiments of handwritten digit recognition and numeral string recognition on the NIST Special Database 19 (SD19). The digit recognition task was also benchmarked on two standard databases USPS and MNIST. The results show that the performance of CFPC is superior to that of ordinary PC, and is competitive with support vector classifiers (SVCs).

#!Desirability of an action, often referred to as utility or value, is determined by various factors, such as the probability and timing of expected reward. We investigated how performance of monkeys in an oculomotor serial reaction time task is influenced by multiple motivational factors. The animals produced a series of visually-guided eye movements, while the sequence of target locations and the location of the rewarded target were systematically manipulated. The results show that error rates as well as saccade latencies were consistently influenced by the number of remaining movements necessary to obtain a reward. In addition, when the animal produced multiple saccades before fixating a given target, the first saccade tended to be directed towards the rewarded location, suggesting that saccades to rewarded location and visual target might be programmed concurrently. These results show that monkeys can utilize information about the required sequence of movements to update their subjective values.

#!Computation of similarity between categorical data objects in unsupervised learning is an important data mining problem. We propose a method to compute distance between two attribute values of same attribute for unsupervised learning. This approach is based on the fact that similarity of two attribute values is dependent on their relationship with other attributes. Computational cost of this method is linear with respect to number of data objects in data set. To see the effectiveness of our proposed distance measure, we use proposed distance measure with K-mode clustering algorithm to cluster various categorical data sets. Significant improvement in clustering accuracy is observed as compared to clustering results obtained using traditional K-mode clustering algorithm.

#t2006
#cTheory of Computing Systems
#index70
#!We study the problem of how resilient networks are to node faults. Specifically, we investigate the question of how many faults a network can sustain and still contain a large (i.e., linear-sized) connected component with approximately the same expansion as the original fault-free network. We use a pruning technique that culls away those parts of the faulty network that have poor expansion. The faults may occur at random or be caused by an adversary. Our techniques apply in either case. In the adversarial setting we prove that for every network with expansion $\alpha,$ a large connected component with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for up to a constant times $\alpha \cdot n$ faults. We show this result is tight in the sense that every graph G of size n and uniform expansion $\alpha(\cdot)$ can be broken into components of size o(n) with $\omega(\alpha(n) \cdot n)$ faults. Unlike the adversarial case, the expansion of a graph gives a very weak bound on its resilience to random faults. While it is the case, as before, that there are networks of uniform expansion $\Omega(1/{\rm log}\, n)$ that are not resilient against a fault probability of a constant times $1/{\log}\, n,$ it is also observed that there are networks of uniform expansion $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ that are resilient against a constant fault probability. Thus, we introduce a different parameter, called the span of a graph, which gives us a more precise handle on the maximum fault probability. We use the span to show the first known results for the effect of random faults on the expansion of d-dimensional meshes.

#!The self-organization of particles in a two phase system in the coexistence region through a diffusive mechanism is known as Ostwald ripening. This phenomenon is an example of a multiscale problem in that the microscopic level interaction of the particles can greatly impact the macroscale or observable morphology of the system. Ostwald ripening is studied here through the use of a mesoscopic model which is a stochastic partial integrodifferential equation that is derived from a spin exchange Ising model. This model is studied through the use of recently developed and benchmarked spectral schemes for the simulation of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations. The typical cluster size is observed to grow like t1/3 over range of times with faster growth at later times. The results included here also demonstrate the effect of adjusting the interparticle interaction on the morphological evolution of the system at the macroscopic level.

#!Recently the declining costs of computer hardware, combined with the rapidly increasing costs of software systems have led to considerable discussion of computer organizations. When a computing system is viewed as a data structure, a control structure, and a processing structure designed to execute algorithms, it is reasonable to consider how this system can be optimized in both a hardware sense, and in the sense of reducing the total system software costs. A reasonable approach to greater efficiency is to design computer systems whose structure more closely resembles that of the higher level language in which the algorithms are to be expressed.

#*Three-Level Caching for Efficient Query Processing in Large Web Search Engines
#@Xiaohui Long,Torsten Suel
#t2006
#cWorld Wide Web
#index86
#!Large web search engines have to answer thousands of queries per second with interactive response times. Due to the sizes of the data sets involved, often in the range of multiple terabytes, a single query may require the processing of hundreds of megabytes or more of index data. To keep up with this immense workload, large search engines employ clusters of hundreds or thousands of machines, and a number of techniques such as caching, index compression, and index and query pruning are used to improve scalability. In particular, two-level caching techniques cache results of repeated identical queries at the frontend, while index data for frequently used query terms are cached in each node at a lower level. We propose and evaluate a three-level caching scheme that adds an intermediate level of caching for additional performance gains. This intermediate level attempts to exploit frequently occurring pairs of terms by caching intersections or projections of the corresponding inverted lists. We propose and study several offline and online algorithms for the resulting weighted caching problem, which turns out to be surprisingly rich in structure. Our experimental evaluation based on a large web crawl and real search engine query log shows significant performance gains for the best schemes, both in isolation and in combination with the other caching levels. We also observe that a careful selection of cache admission and eviction policies is crucial for best overall performance.

This practical, problem-solving guide is ideal if you're an engineer, programmer, or researcher writing an application for one of the legions of platforms on which C++ runs. The algorithms provided in C++ Cookbook will jump-start your development by giving you some basic building blocks that you don't have to develop on your own. Less a tutorial than a problem-solver, the book addresses many of the most common problems you're likely encounter--whether you've been programming in C++ for years or you're relatively new to the language. Here are just some of the time-consuming tasks this book contains practical solutions for: Reading the contents of a directory Creating a singleton class Date and time parsing/arithmetic String and text manipulation Working with files Parsing XML Using the standard containers Typical of O'Reilly's "Cookbook" series, C++ Cookbook is written in a straightforward format, featuring recipes that contain problem statements and code solutions, and apply not to hypothetical situations, but those that you're likely to encounter. A detailed explanation then follows each recipe in order to show you how and why the solution works. This question-solution-discussion format is a proven teaching method, as any fan of the "Cookbook" series can attest to. This book will move quickly to the top of your list of essential C++ references.

#!This paper presents an algorithm to model volumetric data and other one for non-rigid registration of such models using spheres formulated in the geometric algebra framework. The proposed algorithm for modeling, as opposite to the Union of Spheres method, reduces the number of entities (spheres) used to model 3D data. Our proposal is based in marching cubes idea using, however, spheres, while the Union of Spheres uses Delaunay tetrahedrization. The non-rigid registration is accomplished in a deterministic annealing scheme. At the preprocessing stage we segment the objects of interest by a segmentation method based on texture information. This method is embedded in a region growing scheme. As our final application, we present a scheme for surgical object tracking using again geometric algebra techniques.

Uses progressive enhancement techniques to ensure graceful degradation (which makes sites usable in all browsers). Shows readers how to write their own Ajax scripts instead of relying on third-party libraries.Web site designers love the idea of Ajax--of creating Web pages in which information can be updated without refreshing the entire page. But for those who aren't hard-core programmers, enhancing pages using Ajax can be a challenge. Even more of a challenge is making sure those pages work for all users. In Bulletproof Ajax, author Jeremy Keith demonstrates how developers comfortable with CSS and (X)HTML can build Ajax functionality without frameworks, using the ideas of graceful degradation and progressive enhancement to ensure that the pages work for all users. Throughout this step-by-step guide, his emphasis is on best practices with an approach to building Ajax pages called Hijax, which improves flexibility and avoids worst-case scenarios.

#!Browsing activities are an important source of information to build profiles of the user interests and personalize the human-computer interaction during information seeking tasks. Visited pages are easily collectible, e.g., from browsers' histories and toolbars, or desktop search tools, and they often contain documents related to the current user needs. Nevertheless, menus, advertisements or pages that cover multiple topics affect negatively the advantages of an implicit feedback technique that exploits these data to build and keep updated user profiles. This work describes a technique to collect text relevant to the current needs from sequences of pages visited by the user. The evaluation shows how it outperforms other techniques that consider the whole page contents. We also introduce an improvement based on machine learning techniques that is currently under evaluation.

#@Salem Benferhat,Didier Dubois,Souhila Kaci,Henri Prade

#cInformation Fusion
#index125
#!The bipolar view in preference modeling distinguishes between negative and positive preferences. Negative preferences correspond to what is rejected, considered unacceptable, while positive preferences correspond to what is desired. But what is tolerated (i.e., not rejected) is not necessarily desired. Both negative and positive preferences can be a matter of degree. Bipolar preferences can be represented in possibilistic logic by two separate sets of formulas: prioritized constraints, which describe what is more or less tolerated, and weighted positive preferences, expressing what is particularly desirable. The problem of merging multiple-agent preferences in this bipolar framework is then discussed. Negative and positive preferences are handled separately and are combined in distinct ways. Since negative and positive preferences are stated separately, they may be inconsistent, especially in this context of preference fusion. Consistency can be enforced by restricting what is desirable to what is tolerated. After merging, and once the bipolar consistency is restored, the set of preferred solutions can be logically characterized. Preferred solutions should have the highest possible degree of feasibility, and only constraints with low priority may have to be discarded in case of inconsistency inside negative preferences. Moreover, preferred solutions should satisfy important positive preferences when feasible (positive preferences may be also inconsistent). Two types of preferred solutions can be characterized, either in terms of a disjunctive combination of the weighted positive preferences, or in terms of a cardinality-based evaluation.

#cJournal of Computational Physics
#index127
#!The present paper describes the numerical technique that has been developed, in the framework of the particle-in-cell (PIC) method, to study the dynamics of a nonneutral plasma along the magnetic field lines. In particular, the technique has been employed to simulate the formation and long-term evolution of large-amplitude electrostatic waves experimentally observed in electron plasmas confined in a Penning trap [W. Bertsche, J. Fajans, L. Friedland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 (2003) 265003]. Due to the peculiar features of the physical system, namely the existence of different time scales and the presence of a perturbative oscillating potential, ad hoc numerical techniques have been developed. In particular, with a suitable radial decomposition all important two-dimensional phenomena are fully taken into account while keeping the computational effort to that of a standard one-dimensional PIC codes. Moreover, a novel particle loading technique (ergodic loading) has been developed, which ensures a significant reduction of numerical noise. The results obtained with the present technique are in excellent agreement with the experiments [F. Peinetti, W. Bertsche, J. Fajans, J. Wurtele, L. Friedland, Phys. Plasmas 12 (2005) 062112]. Moreover, results presented here furnish clear evidences of the close relationship between the observed nonlinear structures and the Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes.

#!We introduce the logical story behind file input in ACL2 and discuss the types of theorems that can be proven about file-reading operations. We develop a low level library for reasoning about the primitive input routines. We then develop a representation for Unicode text, and implement efficient functions to translate our representation to and from the UTF-8 encoding scheme. We introduce an efficient function to read UTF-8-encoded files, and prove that when files are well formed, the function produces valid Unicode text which corresponds to the contents of the file.We find exhaustive testing to be a useful technique for proving many theorems in this work. We show how ACL2 can be directed to prove a theorem by exhaustive testing.

#!Finite difference approximations of the second derivative in space appearing in, parabolic, incompletely parabolic systems of, and 2nd-order hyperbolic, partial differential equations are considered. If the solution is pointwise bounded, we prove that finite difference approximations of those classes of equations can be closed with two orders less accuracy at the boundary without reducing the global order of accuracy.This result is generalised to initial-boundary value problems with an mth-order principal part. Then, the boundary accuracy can be lowered m orders.Further, it is shown that schemes using summation-by-parts operators that approximate second derivatives are pointwise bounded. Linear and nonlinear computations, including the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, corroborate the theoretical results.

#!In this paper we present a framework for scenarios in simulation games. It is used to support developing, using, and managing complex and dynamic simulation games, and it supports the achievement of the game's learning goal. Especially game facilitation is increasingly challenging due to the nature of these simulation games. The framework consists of a number of conditions, rules and actions, based on the concept of production systems from artificial intelligence, and it is presented as a component of Zeigler's experimental frame. This has been successfully used in the Distributor Game, which is the first of a series of management games developed for today's supply chain management challenges. Further research will focus on the extension of the set of conditions, rules and actions, and on visualizing and managing the interdependencies between the simulation game, its scenario, and the players.

#*Fusionplex: resolution of data inconsistencies in the integration of heterogeneous information sources
#@Amihai Motro,Philipp Anokhin
#t2006
#cInformation Fusion
#index169
#!Fusionplex is a system for integrating multiple heterogeneous and autonomous information sources that uses data fusion to resolve factual inconsistencies among the individual sources. To accomplish this, the system relies on source features, which are meta-data on the merits of each information source; for example, the recentness of the data, its accuracy, its availability, or its cost. The fusion process is controlled with several parameters: (1) with a vector of feature weights, each user defines an individual notion of data utility; (2) with thresholds of acceptance, users ensure minimal performance of their data, excluding from the fusion process data that are too old, too costly, or lacking in authority, or numeric data that are too high, too low, or obvious outliers; and, ultimately, (3) in naming a particular fusion function to be used for each attribute (for example, average, maximum, or simply any) users implement their own interpretation of fusion. Several simple extensions to SQL are all that is needed to allow users to state these resolution parameters, thus ensuring that the system is easy to use. Altogether, Fusionplex provides its users with powerful and flexible, yet simple, control over the fusion process. In addition, Fusionplex supports other critical integration requirements, such as information source heterogeneity, dynamic evolution of the information environment, quick ad-hoc integration, and intermittent source availability. The methods described in this paper were implemented in a prototype system that provides complete Web-based integration services for remote clients.

#!This conference, organized jointly by the National Physical Laboratory and the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications, was a sequel to the one on unconstrained optimization held in January 1971. The intention was that the papers should all be expository in nature, providing a broad survey of fundamental and useful techniques. In spite of the extra constraints imposed by the Emergency Power Regulations (the proceedings of the first day being held in an atmosphere of increasing gloom due to the fact that lights were not permitted at N.P.L. that day) the aim of the Conference was achieved. The standard of the papers was unusually high and clearly much effort had been taken, both collectively and individually; one small, but useful, indication being the use of a common notation. The major criticism that could be leveled would be to do with the amount of material covered in some of the sessions making it a very intensive course indeed, and leading, perhaps, to some feeling of mental indigestion. Fortunately, pre- or post-prints of most of the talks were available or promised, and the complete proceedings are to be published.

#!This paper presents a new algorithm to produce a near optimal mixture of experts model (MEM) architecture for a continuous mapping. The MEM is applied to a new method incorporating photon scatter for designing compensators for intensity modulated radiation therapy. The algorithm utilizes the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm to partition data before training commences. A reduction in the size of training sets also allows the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to be implemented. As a result, both training time and validation error are reduced. A 71% reduction in prediction error compared with that of a single neural network is achieved.

#!In this paper we propose a traffic predictor based on multiresolution decomposition for the adaptive bandwidth control in locally controlled self-sizing networks. A selfsizing network can provide quantitative packet-level QoS to aggregate traffic by allocating link/switch capacity automatically and adaptively using online traffic data. In a locally controlled network such as Internet, resource allocation decisions are made at the node level. We show that wavelet based adaptive bandwidth control method performs better than other popular methods like Gaussian predictor for such applications. We have compared the performance of different ortho-normal wavelets and found that Haar wavelet is best suited for traffic prediction. We have studied the effect of other wavelet parameters such as size of the window and number of filter coefficients. We also propose a novel adaptive wavelet predictor which can adapt very well to the changes of incoming bursty traffic.

#!The real-time execution of contemporary complex media applications requires energy-efficient processing capabilities beyond those of current superscalar processors. We observe that the complexity of contemporary media applications requires support for multiple forms of parallelism, including ILP, TLP, and various forms of DLP, such as subword SIMD, short vectors, and streams. Based on our observations, we propose an architecture, called ALP, that efficiently integrates all of these forms of parallelism with evolutionary changes to the programming model and hardware. The novel part of ALP is a DLP technique called SIMD vectors and streams (SVectors/SStreams), which is integrated within a conventional superscalar-based CMP/SMT architecture with subword SIMD. This technique lies between subword SIMD and vectors, providing significant benefits over the former at a lower cost than the latter. Our evaluations show that each form of parallelism supported by ALP is important. Specifically, SVectors/SStreams are effective, compared to a system with the other enhancements in ALP. They give speedups of 1.1 to 3.4X and energy-delay product improvements of 1.1 to 5.1X for applications with DLP.

#!The numerical accuracy of the Interpolated Differential Operator (IDO) scheme is studied with Fourier analysis for the solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs): advection, diffusion, and Poisson equations. The IDO scheme solves governing equations not only for physical variable but also for first-order spatial derivative. Spatial discretizations are based on Hermite interpolation functions with both of them. In the Fourier analysis for the IDO scheme, the Fourier coefficients of the physical variable and the first-order derivative are coupled by the equations derived from the governing equations. The analysis shows the IDO scheme resolves all the wavenumbers with higher accuracy than the fourth-order Finite Difference (FD) and Compact Difference (CD) schemes for advection equation. In particular, for high wavenumbers, the accuracy is superior to that of the sixth-order Combined Compact Difference (CCD) scheme. The diffusion and Poisson equations are also more accurately solved in comparison with the FD and CD schemes. These results show that the IDO scheme guarantees highly resolved solutions for all the terms of fluid flow equations.

#!Motivation: Protein sequence alignment plays a critical role in computational biology as it is an integral part in many analysis tasks designed to solve problems in comparative genomics, structure and function prediction, and homology modeling. Methods: We have developed novel sequence alignment algorithms that compute the alignment between a pair of sequences based on short fixed- or variable-length high-scoring subsequences. Our algorithms build the alignments by repeatedly selecting the highest scoring pairs of subsequences and using them to construct small portions of the final alignment. We utilize PSI-BLAST generated sequence profiles and employ a profile-to-profile scoring scheme derived from PICASSO. Results: We evaluated the performance of the computed alignments on two recently published benchmark datasets and compared them against the alignments computed by existing state-of-the-art dynamic programming-based profile-to-profile local and global sequence alignment algorithms. Our results show that the new algorithms achieve alignments that are comparable with or better than those achieved by existing algorithms. Moreover, our results also showed that these algorithms can be used to provide better information as to which of the aligned positions are more reliable---a critical piece of information for comparative modeling applications.

#!It is well known that one-step Rosenbrock methods may suffer from order reduction for very stiff problems. By considering two-step methods we construct s-stage methods where all stage values have stage order s-1. The proposed class of methods is stable in the sense of zero-stability for arbitrary stepsize sequences. Furthermore there exist L(α)-stable methods with large α for s=4,...,8. Using the concept of effective order we derive methods having order s for constant stepsizes. Numerical experiments show an efficiency superior to RODAS for more stringent tolerances.

#!To exercise better control on the lower tail of the loss distribution and to easily describe the investor's risk attitude, a new class of coherent risk measures is proposed in this paper by taking the minimization of p-norms of lower losses with respect to some reference point. We demonstrate that the new risk measure has satisfactory mathematical properties such as convexity, continuity with respect to parameters included in its definition, the relations between two new risk measures are also examined. The application of the new risk measures for optimal portfolio selection is illustrated by using trade data from the Chinese stock markets. Empirical results not only support our theoretical conclusions, but also show the practicability of the portfolio selection model with our new risk measures.

#!Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) play a significant role in enhancing rural development in developing countries. However, rural ICT projects are confronted with challenges that result in projects that are not sustainable, or fail altogether. These challenges include access to infrastructure, limited formal education, insufficient training and capacity building, financial and political constraints, and social and cultural challenges. Sustainability is key to the effectiveness of a rural ICT project, therefore it is important to understand the concept and categories associated with ICT project sustainability in rural areas. The categories are social and cultural, institutional, economic, political, and technological sustainability. An exploration of the categories of sustainability is undertaken on an ICT project in rural Dwesa.

#*MRP Rescheduling heuristics with capacity extension under deterministic demand

#!The multi-stage, multi-machine capacitated lot-sizing problem (MSMMCLSP) consists of scheduling the production of one product in a multi-machine production system with a multi-stage structure. Machine capacity is reserved for the production of the end item but can be extended by working overtime (overtime capacity). When a lot size is positive in a specific period, it can be loaded on all machines without exceeding the sum of the regular and overtime capacity limits. In previous research [Rong, C., Takahashi, K., & Morikawa, K. (2005). A new heuristic method for capacitated lot-sizing in multi-stage, multi-machine production systems. Journal of Japan Industrial Management Association, 56(5), in press], we have proposed a rescheduling heuristic to determine a feasible and sufficient solution for the MSMMCLSP with only regular capacity limits, in comparison with Franca et al.'s heuristic method. However, the mechanism of rescheduling in regular time has not optimum (or near optimum) performance for the MSMMCLSP with capacity extension. Preliminary examination revealed that overtime production also has situation-dependent advantages and disadvantages with the combination of various planning parameters. This study, therefore, develops an integrated heuristic that guarantees an optimal solution for general MSMMCLSP by combining the rescheduling mechanism and overtime production. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics by using computational tests with various planning parameters.

#*Large area micro hot embossing of Pyrex glass with GC mold machined by dicing
#@Masaharu Takahashi,Yoichi Murakoshi,Ryutaro Maeda,Kohei Hasegawa

#cMicrosystem Technologies
#index274
#!Micro/Nano imprinting or hot embossing is currently a target of interest for industrial production of micro and Nano devices for the low cost aspect. In Fluidic MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) applications, polymer materials have been widely employed for their low cost to fabricate the economical products (Becker and Heim in Sens Acuators A 83:120&#x2013;135, 2000; Becker and Gaertner in Mol Biotechnol 82:89&#x2013;99, 2001). However glasses are much more suitable for the higher temperature applications or under the stronger chemical environments. Moreover UV absorption of glass materials is much less than that of polymers, which is the advantage for bio-analysis. In Optical MEMS as well, glasses are good candidate materials for the better optical properties, such as high refractive index, low UV absorption and others. Although wet etching of glasses is widely employed for fabrication of fluidic MEMS devices, the wet etching is not satisfactory for the low machining resolution, the isotropic etched profile and poor roughness of the fabricated structures. Dry etching of glasses is then an alternative for Micro/Nano structuring, but the etching rate is extremely low (order of 0.1&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m/min) and the cost is too high because of the expensive RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) facility. Above mentioned is the reason why we are interested in hot embossing or imprinting of glasses of Micro/Nano scale. In our previous study, Micro/Nano imprinting was developed for Pyrex glasses using GC (Glassy Carbon) mold prepared by FIB machining (Takahashi et al. in Symposium on DTIP 2004 pp 441&#x2013;446, 2004). The disadvantage of FIB machining is limited area of etching. The typical area of FIB is less than several hundreds micrometer square. This is the reason why we tried the large area of embossing using GC mold fabricated by dicing machine. Micro hot embossed test structures were successfully demonstrated with good fidelity. Fabricated micro structures can be applied for fabrication of microchamber array for PCR (Akagi et al. in Sci Techol Adv Mater 5:343&#x2013;349, 2004; Nagai et al. in Anal Chem 73:1043&#x2013;1047, 2001).

#!Polymeric microfluidic chips are an enabling component for cost-effective, point of care analytical devices for pharmaceutical, agriculture, health, biological and medical applications. The microfluidic structures can be completed with active elements like pumps and valves as well as sensor components for more complex so called total analysis systems. Often, systems are designed as reader and disposable cartridge where the fluidic structures are simple devices that will be inserted into the reader, which executes the analytical protocol and displays the information in digital form, and disposed after completion of the analysis. In this paper, a hybrid fabrication approach was employed to build a polymeric microfluidic device, so-called sweatstick, suitable for collecting small, precise amounts (600&#x00a0;&#x03bc;l) of human sweat, which were further analyzed for the amount of calcium ions indicating bone mass loss. The device was assembled from different parts fabricated by ultra deep X-ray lithography, precision micro-milling, and molding. Surface treatment of liquid exposed surfaces by oxygen plasma ensures hydrophilic behavior and proper capillary action. Preliminary testing of the device was performed by collecting defined amounts of sweat simulant and determining the calcium ion content using a fluorescent technique. The results for low calcium ion concentration typical for human sweat were excellent and repeatable with variation less than 5% demonstrating the ability to perform indirect bone loss measurements.

#!Modern real-time systems consist of complex parallel and heterogeneous architectures. Early design decisions, such as the partitioning of functionality onto architecture building blocks and the choice of algorithms, have a large impact on the quality of the resulting platform. In order to support the designer during this concept phase we have developed our performance evaluation framework SystemQ. In this paper, we demonstrate why multiclass queuing networks as used by SystemQ are a natural abstraction for evaluating network processing platforms. In particular we reveal the impact of scheduling policies on the Quality-of- Service, such as the residence time of network traffic in the system. For the same stimuli the packet latency can vary by more than one order of magnitude if only one queuing discipline in the system is modified.

#!Mobile handsets have found an important place in modern society, with hundreds of millions currently in use. The majority of these devices use inherently weak authentication mechanisms, based upon passwords and PINs. This paper presents a feasibility study into a biometric-based technique, known as keystroke analysis &#x2013; which authenticates the user based upon their typing characteristic. In particular, this paper identifies two typical handset interactions, entering telephone numbers and typing text messages, and seeks to authenticate the user during their normal handset interaction. It was found that neural network classifiers were able to perform classification with average equal error rates of 12.8%. Based upon these results, the paper concludes by proposing a flexible and robust framework to permit the continuous and transparent authentication of the user, thereby maximising security and minimising user inconvenience, to service the needs of the insecure and evermore functional mobile handset.

#!In this paper, we focus on affect recognition from text in order to facilitate sensitive and expressive communication in computer-mediated environments. Our model for analyzing affect conveyed by text is tailored to handle the style and specifics of informal online conversations. The motivation behind our approach is to improve social interactivity and emotional expressiveness of real-time messaging.In order to estimate affect in text, our model processes symbolic cues, such as emoticons, detects and transforms abbreviations, and employs natural language processing techniques for word/phrase/sentence-level analysis, e.g. by considering relations among words in a sentence. As a result of the analysis, text can be categorized into emotional states and communicative functions. A designed graphical representation of a user (avatar) displays emotions and social behaviour driven by text and performs natural idle movements. The proposed system shows promising results on affect recognition in real examples of online conversation.

#!A module-based modeling method was developed to analyze the production-distribution systems by using a discrete event simulation with ARENA. Excel VBA was also adopted to automatically generate the simulation programs. Using the proposed method, one can quickly create a multistage, multi-item supply chain system such as serials, convergent, divergent or general networks, for analyzing the performance of a supply chain. Both inventory control and shipment consolidation policy were considered in this study. A number of outputs can be used as a performance measure in the decision making; for example, transportation costs, inventory level and costs, and the fill rate. An actual application model was generated using the proposed method. The result shows that the module-based method is a powerful tool for modeling the supply chain systems.

#*A New Scheme to Realize the Optimum Watermark Detection for the Additive Embedding Scheme with the Spatial Domain
#@Takaaki Fujita,Maki Yoshida,Toru Fujiwara
#t2007
#cIEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics, Communications and Computer Sciences
#index299
#!A typical watermarking scheme consists of an embedding scheme and a detection scheme. In detecting a watermark, there are two kinds of detection errors, a false positive error (FPE) and a false negative error (FNE). A detection scheme is said to be optimum if the FNE probability is minimized for a given FPE probability. In this paper, we present an optimum watermark detection scheme for an additive embedding scheme with a spatial domain. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to use the differences between two brightnesses for detecting a watermark. We prove that under the same FPE probability the FNE probability of the proposed optimum detection scheme is no more than that of the previous optimum detection scheme for the additive embedding scheme with the spatial domain. Then, it is confirmed that for an actual image, the FNE probability of the proposed optimum detection scheme is much lower than that of the previous optimum detection scheme. Moreover, it is confirmed experimentally that the proposed optimum detection scheme can control the FPE probability strictly so that the FPE probability is close to a given probability.

#!We consider a variant of Heilbronn's triangle problem by asking for a distribution of n points in the d-dimensional unit cube [0, 1]d such that the minimum (two-dimensional) area of a triangle among these n points is as large as possible. Denoting by Δdoff-line (n) and Δdon-line (n) the supremum of the minimum area of a triangle among n points over all distributions of n points in [0, 1]d for the off-line and the on-line situation, respectively, for fixed dimension d ≥ 2 we show that c1ċ(log n)1/(d-1)/n2/(d-1) ≤ Δdoff-line(n) ≤ c'1/n2/d and c2/n2/(d-1) ≤ Δdon-line (n) ≤ c'2/n2/d for constants c1, c2, c'1,c'2 > 0 which depend on d only. Moreover, we provide a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that achieves the lower bound Ω((log n)1/(d-1))/n2/(d-1)) on the minimum area of a triangle among n points in [0, 1]d in the off-line case.

#!Suffix trees and suffix arrays are widely used and largely interchangeable index structures on strings and sequences. Practitioners prefer suffix arrays due to their simplicity and space efficiency while theoreticians use suffix trees due to linear-time construction algorithms and more explicit structure. We narrow this gap between theory and practice with a simple linear-time construction algorithm for suffix arrays. The simplicity is demonstrated with a C&plus;&plus; implementation of 50 effective lines of code. The algorithm is called DC3, which stems from the central underlying concept of difference cover. This view leads to a generalized algorithm, DC, that allows a space-efficient implementation and, moreover, supports the choice of a space--time tradeoff. For any v &isin; &lsqb;1,&nradic;&rsqb;, it runs in O(vn) time using O(n/&vradic;) space in addition to the input string and the suffix array. We also present variants of the algorithm for several parallel and hierarchical memory models of computation. The algorithms for BSP and EREW-PRAM models are asymptotically faster than all previous suffix tree or array construction algorithms.

#!Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused on the construction of exponential integrators for semilinear problems. In this article we describe a MATLAB1 package which aims to facilitate the quick deployment and testing of exponential integrators, of Runge--Kutta, multistep, and general linear type. A large number of integrators are included in this package along with several well-known examples. The so-called &phiv; functions and their evaluation is crucial for accuracy, stability, and efficiency of exponential integrators, and the approach taken here is through a modification of the scaling and squaring technique, the most common approach used for computing the matrix exponential.

#!Personal Networks and PN federations are new networking paradigms that merge concepts from ad hoc, P2P and wireless networks, built around user's needs. Even though they are a promise of a practical achievement of ubiquitous computing, managing security associations in these frameworks proves to be a challenge. We present in this paper a security architecture, including a uniform personal namespace using crypto-based identifiers and a key management scheme based on identity-based cryptography. We also provide an evaluation of our scheme, in terms of computation complexity, communication cost and security.

#!With the diverging improvements in CPU speeds and memory access latencies, detecting and removing memory access bottlenecks becomes increasingly important. In this work we present METRIC, a software framework for isolating and understanding such bottlenecks using partial access traces. METRIC extracts access traces from executing programs without special compiler or linker support. We make four primary contributions. First, we present a framework for extracting partial access traces based on dynamic binary rewriting of the executing application. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm for compressing these traces. The algorithm generates constant space representations for regular accesses occurring in nested loop structures. Third, we use these traces for offline incremental memory hierarchy simulation. We extract symbolic information from the application executable and use this to generate detailed source-code correlated statistics including per-reference metrics, cache evictor information, and stream metrics. Finally, we demonstrate how this information can be used to isolate and understand memory access inefficiencies. This illustrates a potential advantage of METRIC over compile-time analysis for sample codes, particularly when interprocedural analysis is required.

#!In the last years there has been a growing interest worldwide in the application of agent technology for providing dynamic, flexible, and compound services. In this paper we report the design and implementation of a multi-agent system that provides health care-related services to the citizens and visitors of a city. The agents of the system allow the user to access his/her medical record, to find out information about the medical centres of the city, and to make a booking to be visited by a particular kind of doctor. Doctors may access and update the medical record of the patient during a visit, and they may also request the performance of clinical tests on the patient. The results of the tests are automatically stored in the patient's medical record, so that they can be accessed by the doctor in the next visit. Two key issues in the design and implementation of the system are discussed: the definition of a basic medical ontology and the implementation of security measures that preserve the confidentiality of sensitive medical information.

#!In this paper we present an explicit disk-based verification algorithm for Probabilistic Systems defining discrete time/finite state Markov Chains. Given a Markov Chain and an integer k (horizon), our algorithm checks whether the probability of reaching an error state in at most k steps is below a given threshold. We present an implementation of our algorithm within a suitable extension of the Mur&#x03d5; verifier. We call the resulting probabilistic model checker FHP-Mur&#x03d5; (Finite Horizon ProbabilisticMur&#x03d5;). We present experimental results comparing FHP-Mur&#x03d5; with (a finite horizon subset of) PRISM, a state-of-the-art symbolic model checker for Markov Chains. Our experimental results show that FHP-Mur&#x03d5; can handle systems that are out of reach for PRISM, namely those involving arithmetic operations on the state variables (e.g. hybrid systems).

#!Prediction of the cellular location of a protein plays an important role in inferring the function of the protein. Feature extraction is a critical part in prediction systems, requiring raw sequence data to be transformed into appropriate numerical feature vectors while minimizing information loss. In this paper, we present a method for extracting useful features from protein sequence data. The method employs local and global pairwise sequence alignment scores as well as composition-based features. Five different features are used for training support vector machines (SVMs) separately and a weighted majority voting makes a final decision. The overall prediction accuracy evaluated by the 5-fold cross-validation reached 88.53% for the eukaryotic animal data set. Comparing the prediction accuracy of various feature extraction methods, provides a biological insight into the location of targeting information. Our experimental results confirm that our feature extraction methods are very useful for predicting subcellular localization of proteins.

#!Organizations change with the dynamics of the world. To enable organizations to change, certain structures and capabilities are needed. As all processes, a change process has an organization of its own. In this paper it is shown how within a formal organization modeling approach also organizational change processes can be modeled. A generic organization model (covering both organization structure and behavior) for organizational change is presented and formally evaluated for a case study. This model takes into account different phases in a change process considered in Organization Theory literature, such as unfreezing, movement and refreezing. Moreover, at the level of individuals, the internal beliefs and their changes are incorporated in the model. In addition, an internal mental model for (reflective) reasoning about expected role behavior is included in the organization model.

#!In this paper, we propose a novel path-based control method for generating realistic smoke animations. Our method allows an animator to specify a 3D curve for the smoke to follow. Path control is then achieved using a linear (closed) feedback loop to match the velocity field obtained from a 3D flow simulation with a target velocity field. The target velocity field can be generated in a variety of ways and may include the small scale swirling motion characteristic of turbulent flows. We provide several examples of complex smoke paths to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

#!This paper investigates the compositional properties of reusable software components defined with explicit dependencies and behavioural contracts expressing rely-guarantee specifications in the form of communication traces. In this setting, connection of components through their matching ports is indeed compositional and yields a new component or composite that respects its constituents' contracts. Thus the behaviour of the composite is computed from the behaviours of its constituents and is known to conform to the contracts without any new proof.

#!In this paper, we propose an optimization-based approach for Quality of Service (QoS) routing in high-bandwidth networks. We view a network that employs QoS routing as an entity that distributively optimizes some global utility function. By solving the optimization problem, the network is driven to an efficient operating point. In earlier work, it has been shown that when the capacity of the network is large, this optimization takes on a simple form, and once the solution to this optimization problem is found, simple proportional QoS routing schemes will suffice. However, this optimization problem requires global information. We develop a distributed and adaptive algorithm that can efficiently solve the optimization online. Compared with existing QoS routing schemes, the proposed optimization-based approach has the following advantages: 1) the computation and communication overhead can be greatly reduced without sacrificing performance; 2) the operating characteristics of the network can be analytically studied; and 3) the desired operating point can be tuned by choosing appropriate utility functions.

#!Enterprise integration through integrated business information systems (IBIS) is necessary to achieve agility in the current age of hyper-competition. Multi-agent systems (MAS) provide a new paradigm for IBIS development. In this paper, we review the IBIS modeling and MAS literatures and find that the MAS paradigm provides an excellent approach for modeling and implementing IBIS systems. We synthesize these two bodies of literature and propose a conceptual framework for multi-agent-based integrative business information systems (MIBIS) and a unified set of eight orthogonal ontological constructs that are minimally required for any conceptual modeling grammar for the MIBIS bounded universe of discourse.

#!Traffic microsimulation is increasingly a preferred method of traffic analysis for today's transportation professionals. The importance of properly calibrating these traffic simulations is evidenced by the adoption of microsimulation calibration standards by several state and federal transportation authorities. A component of the calibration process is the calibration of the simulation for capacity. Capacity is a high-level measurement that is a function of many lower-level user-defined input parameters. VISSIM utilizes psy-chophysical car-following models that rely on ten user-defined parameters to represent freeway driving behavior. Several VISSIM driver behavior parameters have been shown to have a significant impact on roadway capacity. This paper seeks further understanding of the performance of the VISSIM traffic microsimulator by investigating the impact of driver behavior parameter combinations on a measure of freeway capacity. This paper is intended to provide insight useful for manual calibration of VISSIM microsimulation or the development of calibration algorithms.

#!Language model information retrieval depends on accurate estimation of document models. In this paper, we propose a document expansion technique to deal with the problem of insufficient sampling of documents. We construct a probabilistic neighborhood for each document, and expand the document with its neighborhood information. The expanded document provides a more accurate estimation of the document model, thus improves retrieval accuracy. Moreover, since document expansion and pseudo feedback exploit different corpus structures, they can be combined to further improve performance. The experiment results on several different data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed document expansion method.

#!A new application architecture is designed for continuous, real-time, distributed wireless sensor networks. We develop a wireless sensor network for machinery condition-based maintenance (CBM) in small machinery spaces using commercially available products. We develop a hardware platform, networking architecture, and medium access communication protocol. We implement a single-hop sensor network to facilitate real-time monitoring and extensive data processing for machine monitoring. A new radio battery consumption model is presented and the battery consumption equation is used to select the most suitable topology and design an energy efficient communication protocol for wireless sensor networks. A new streamlined matrix formulation is developed that allows the base station to compute the best periodic sleep times for all the nodes in the network. We combine scheduling and contention to design a hybrid MAC protocol, which achieves 100&percnt; collision avoidance by using our modified RTS-CTS contention mechanism known as UC-TDMA protocol. A LabVIEW graphical user interface is described that allows for signal processing, including FFT, various moments, and kurtosis. A wireless CBM sensor network implementation on a heating and air conditioning plant is presented as a case study.

#!We investigate the structure of addresses contained in IPv4 traffic--specifically, the structural characteristics of destination IP addresses seen on Internet links, considered as a subset of the address space. These characteristics have implications for algorithms that deal with IP address aggregates, such as routing lookups and aggregate-based congestion control. Several example address structures are well modeled by multifractal Cantor-like sets with two parameters. This model may be useful for simulations where realistic IP addresses are preferred. We also develop concise characterizations of address structures, including active aggregate counts and discriminating prefixes. Our structural characterizations are stable over short time scales at a given site, and different sites have visibly different characterizations, so that the characterizations make useful "fingerprints" of the traffic seen at a site. Also, changing traffic conditions, such as worm propagation, significantly alter these fingerprints.

#!Intelligent desktop environments allow the desktop user to define a set of projects or activities that characterize the user's desktop work. These environments then attempt to identify the current activity of the user in order to provide various kinds of assistance. These systems take a hybrid approach in which they allow the user to declare their current activity but they also employ learned classifiers to predict the current activity to cover those cases where the user forgets to declare the current activity. The classifiers must be trained on the very noisy data obtained from the user's activity declarations. Instead of asking the user to review and relabel the data manually, we employ an active EM algorithm that combines the EM algorithm and active learning. EM can be viewed as retraining on its own predictions. To make it more robust, we only retrain on those predictions that are made with high confidence. For active learning, we make a small number of queries to the user based on the most uncertain instances. Experimental results on real users show this active EM algorithm can significantly improve the prediction precision, and that it performs better than either EM or active learning alone.

#!Software Performance Engineering (SPE) methods have been in use for over two decades as an approach to manage the risks of developing systems that fail to satisfy their performance requirements. In general, SPE advocates the use of performance oriented design principles to guide design decisions and predictive performance models to assess the performance impact of design alternatives. SPE methods have been used successfully to identify and overcome system design blunders early in the Information Technology (IT) project lifecycle before the blunders are built into a system and become expensive and time consuming to correct. While the methods have been used successfully in some IT project domains, they are not widely applied in the important domain of Enterprise Application (EA) systems. This experience paper considers the reasons for this and explores the role of SPE as new EA platform and data centre technologies become available.We find that many risks traditionally addressed by SPE have been mitigated by the nature of existing EA platforms, the nature of today's IT projects for EA, and an attention to business process modeling. Furthermore, the design and implementation of future EA systems will see some performance risks reduced even further by new EA and IT system management platforms for Next Generation Data Centres. However, we expect that the nature of EA systems to be built is becoming more complex. As a result some familiar performance risks will re-emerge along with new runtime risks. We believe that SPE methods can help to mitigate such risks and describe research challenges that must be addressed to make this a reality.

To help you understand VoIP networks, Voice over IP Fundamentals provides a thorough introduction to the basics of VoIP.Voice over IP Fundamentals explains how a basic IP telephony infrastructure is built and works today, major concepts concerning voice and data networking, and transmission of voice over data networks. You'll learn how voice is signaled through legacy telephone networks, how IP signaling protocols are used to interoperate with current telephony systems, and how to ensure good voice quality using quality of service (QoS).Even though Voice over IP Fundamentals is written for anyone seeking to understand how to use IP to transport voice, its target audience comprises both voice and data networking professionals. In the past, professionals working in voice and data networking did not have to understand each other's roles. However, in this world of time-division multiplexing (TDM) and IP convergence, it is important to understand how these technologies work together. Voice over IP Fundamentals explains all the details so that voice experts can understand data networking and data experts can understand voice networking.The second edition of this best-selling book includes new chapters on the importance of billing and mediation in a VoIP network, security, and the common types of threats inherent when packet voice environments, public switched telephone networks (PSTN), and VoIP interoperate. It also explains enterprise and service-provider applications and services.ï¾

#!In this paper we discuss a strategy for reducing the computational cost of a re-parameterisation procedure to be used in algebraic numerical grid generation. The re-parameterisation phase is based on a tensor product transformation following given directions. The free parameters in the tensor product are set by solving the discretization of an elliptic differential system of small size, via an iterative scheme, thus generating a grid conforming to the boundary of a prescribed domain with orthogonal inner grid cells and with almost constant aspect ratio. The bases involved in the tensor product are refinable, i.e., they can be written as linear combination of dilate of translates of their-self. This property allows us to use few iterations of the corresponding subdivision algorithm to produce a good parameter distribution.

#!A simple low-cost technique has been developed to fabricate a mold insert for replicating polymeric tapered high aspect ratio microstructures. A backside exposure technique is used to first obtain a tapered sidewall structure as an electroplating mold in SU-8 photoresist on a glass wafer. Nickel electroplating is utilized to form the mold insert. The lowest average surface roughness of the nickel mold insert on the side that interfaces with the glass wafer during electroplating is measured to be 7.02&#x00a0;nm. A novel technique involving use of titanium putty is introduced here to reduce cost and effort required to fabricate the mold insert. Replication of tapered microstructures in polymeric materials utilizing the fabricated mold insert is demonstrated here in polydimethylsiloxane by a direct molding process and in polymethyl methacrylate by hot embossing. The fabrication details for the mold insert are described. Advantages and disadvantages of the use of titanium putty for achieving superior metal surface finish are given.

#!This paper presents a Web-based interior design application named Multiuser Interior Design (MID). We use technologies from virtual reality (VR), the Web, and database to implement MID. It allows users to operate in the VR fashion, interacting with objects in the 3D, virtual space. Users need only a Web browser to view and elaborate designs, examine furniture, place purchase orders, etc. MID contains many useful functions and features Web-based multiuser collaboration. We introduce the user-interface and main functions of MID that users will operate. The technical aspect of MID, including software architecture and underlying technologies, is also presented. MID can be easily modified for other purposes; only information-related portions need modification, and the other portions serve as reusable framework.

#cInformation Retrieval
#index469
#!Intelligent use of the many diverse forms of data available on the Internet requires new tools for managing and manipulating heterogeneous forms of information. This paper uses WHIRL, an extension of relational databases that can manipulate textual data using statistical similarity measures developed by the information retrieval community. We show that although WHIRL is designed for more general similarity-based reasoning tasks, it is competitive with mature systems designed explicitly for inductive classification. In particular, WHIRL is well suited for combining different sources of knowledge in the classification process. We show on a diverse set of tasks that the use of appropriate sets of unlabeled background knowledge often decreases error rates, particularly if the number of examples or the size of the strings in the training set is small. This is especially useful when labeling text is a labor-intensive job and when there is a large amount of information available about a particular problem on the World Wide Web.

#%163057
#!In this paper, a procedure for dealing with the multi-user synchronisation problem in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based systems for ad hoc environments is proposed and analysed. We show with this novel approach that it is possible to re-use much of the already extent literature for single-user synchronisation in OFDM and apply it to multi-user ad hoc scenarios. Also a distributed version of the procedure is proposed in order to fairly share out the power consumption among all the devices. The proposed procedure makes use of higher layer capabilities in a cross-layer design and it does not incur too much complexity or power. This issue is specially critical in wireless heterogeneous ad hoc networks where devices can be very limited in terms of transmission and/or computational power.

#index473
#!Conditional random fields (CRFs) have been successfully applied to various applications of predicting and labeling structured data, such as natural language tagging & parsing, image segmentation & object recognition, and protein secondary structure prediction. The key advantages of CRFs are the ability to encode a variety of overlapping, non-independent features from empirical data as well as the capability of reaching the global normalization and optimization. However, estimating parameters for CRFs is very time-consuming due to an intensive forward-backward computation needed to estimate the likelihood function and its gradient during training. This paper presents a high-performance training of CRFs on massively parallel processing systems that allows us to handle huge datasets with hundreds of thousand data sequences and millions of features. We performed the experiments on an important natural language processing task (text chunking) on large-scale corpora and achieved significant results in terms of both the reduction of computational time and the improvement of prediction accuracy.

#!A growing number of business process management software vendors are offering simulation capabilities to extend their modeling functions and enhance their analytical proficiencies. Simulation is promoted to enable examination and testing of decisions prior to actually making them in the "real" environment. In this paper, we illustrate how to optimize simulation models, by presenting two examples of simulation optimization using OptQuest&reg;. In the first case, we construct a discrete event simulation model of a hospital emergency room to determine a configuration of resources that results in the shortest average cycle time for patients. In the second case, we develop a simulation model to minimize staffing levels for personal claims processing in an insurance company. We then summarize some of the most relevant approaches that have been developed for the purpose of optimizing simulated systems and conclude with a metaheuristic black box approach that leads the field of practical applications.

#!We present a broad algorithmic framework for transforming an image comprised of pixels into a vectorized image segmented into polygons that can be subsequently used in image analysis, understanding, and high-level representation. We introduce a new entity-the trixel-that is an adaptive, local, triangular unit of region-contour picture description. Adjacent trixels are merged based on certain elementary heuristic criteria of perceptual organization, modeled as geometric filters on trixel edges. The connected components of a trixel grouping graph, with vertices representing trixels and edges between vertices corresponding to merged adjacent trixels, yield polygons that segment the image.

#!We have explored the usefulness of incorporating speech and discourse features in an automatic speech summarization system applied to meeting recordings from the ICSI Meetings corpus. By analyzing speaker activity, turn-taking and discourse cues, we hypothesize that such a system can outperform solely text-based methods inherited from the field of text summarization. The summarization methods are described, two evaluation methods are applied and compared, and the results clearly show that utilizing such features is advantageous and efficient. Even simple methods relying on discourse cues and speaker activity can outperform text summarization approaches.

#*Data representations and generalization error in kernel based learning machines

#cPattern Recognition
#index497
#%441539
#%531457
#!This paper focuses on the problem of how data representation influences the generalization error of kernel based learning machines like support vector machines (SVM) for classification. Frame theory provides a well founded mathematical framework for representing data in many different ways. We analyze the effects of sparse and dense data representations on the generalization error of such learning machines measured by using leave-one-out error given a finite amount of training data. We show that, in the case of sparse data representations, the generalization error of an SVM trained by using polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions is equal to the one of a linear SVM. This is equivalent to saying that the capacity of separating points of functions belonging to hypothesis spaces induced by polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions reduces to the capacity of a separating hyperplane in the input space. Moreover, we show that, in general, sparse data representations increase or leave unchanged the generalization error of kernel based methods. Dense data representations, on the contrary, reduce the generalization error in the case of very large frames. We use two different schemes for representing data in overcomplete systems of Haar and Gabor functions, and measure SVM generalization error on benchmarked data sets.

#!This paper deals with the bias correction of the cross-validation (CV) criterion to estimate the predictive Kullback-Leibler information. A bias-corrected CV criterion is proposed by replacing the ordinary maximum likelihood estimator with the maximizer of the adjusted log-likelihood function. The adjustment is just slight and simple, but the improvement of the bias is remarkable. The bias of the ordinary CV criterion is O(n-1), but that of the bias-corrected CV criterion is O(n-2). We verify that our criterion has smaller bias than the AIC, TIC, EIC and the ordinary CV criterion by numerical experiments.

#*Two's-complement multiplication
#@A. E. Sheue
#t1979
#cACM SIGMICRO Newsletter
#index503
#!Two's complement multiplication, defined in terms of adds, subtracts, and shifts, is derived from a novel expression relating a two's-complement number and its integer interpretation. Although the derived algorithm is considered well known, the derivation itself is believed to be original and easily grasped. Implementation of the algorithm in terms of computer arithmetic is shown to be safe from overflow except for the case when the multiplier is 10...0 (max. negative). In this case, the resulting product will have the proper magnitude but the wrong algebraic sign. The implementation can, however, be modified to handle this special case properly.

#*Lightweight natural language text compression

#cInformation Retrieval

#!Variants of Huffman codes where words are taken as the source symbols are currently the most attractive choices to compress natural language text databases. In particular, Tagged Huffman Code by Moura et al. offers fast direct searching on the compressed text and random access capabilities, in exchange for producing around 11% larger compressed files. This work describes End-Tagged Dense Code and (s, c)-Dense Code, two new semistatic statistical methods for compressing natural language texts. These techniques permit simpler and faster encoding and obtain better compression ratios than Tagged Huffman Code, while maintaining its fast direct search and random access capabilities. We show that Dense Codes improve Tagged Huffman Code compression ratio by about 10%, reaching only 0.6% overhead over the optimal Huffman compression ratio. Being simpler, Dense Codes are generated 45% to 60% faster than Huffman codes. This makes Dense Codes a very attractive alternative to Huffman code variants for various reasons: they are simpler to program, faster to build, of almost optimal size, and as fast and easy to search as the best Huffman variants, which are not so close to the optimal size.

#!We describe a discrete event simulation model of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV disease, parameterized to describe the dual epidemics in Harare, Zimbabwe. TB and HIV are the leading causes of death from infectious disease among adults worldwide and the number of TB cases has risen significantly since the start of the HIV epidemic, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the HIV epidemic is most severe. There is a need to devise new strategies for TB control in countries with a high prevalence of HIV. This model has been designed to investigate strategies for reducing TB transmission by more efficient TB case detection. The model structure and its validation are discussed.

In the latter group only few propose automatic grid alignment and batch mode. More often than not a program implements only one quantification algorithm. AGScan is an open source program that works on all major platforms. It is based on the ImageJ library [Rasband (1997--2006)] and offers a plug-in extension system to add new functions to manipulate images, align grid and quantify spots. It is appropriate for daily laboratory use and also as a framework for new algorithms. Availability: The program is freely distributed under X11 Licence. The install instructions can be found in the user manual. The software can be downloaded from http://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/projects/agscan/.

#!The hit-or-miss transform (HMT) is a fundamental operation on binary images, widely used since 40 years. As it is not increasing, its extension to grey-level images is not straightforward, and very few authors have considered it. Moreover, despite its potential usefulness, very few applications of the grey-level HMT have been proposed until now. Part I of this paper, developed hereafter, is devoted to the description of a theory leading to a unification of the main definitions of the grey-level HMT, mainly proposed by Ronse and Soille, respectively (part II will deal with the applicative potential of the grey-level HMT, which will be illustrated by its use for vessel segmentation from 3D angiographic data). In this first part, we review the previous approaches to the grey-level HMT, especially the supremal one of Ronse, and the integral one of Soille; the latter was defined only for flat structuring elements (SEs), but it can be generalized to non-flat ones. We present a unified theory of the grey-level HMT, which is decomposed into two steps. First a fitting associates to each point the set of grey-levels for which the SEs can be fitted to the image; as in Soille's approach, this fitting step can be constrained. Next, a valuation associates a final grey-level value to each point; we propose three valuations: supremal (as in Ronse), integral (as in Soille) and binary.

#!Traditional Computer Science curricula focus on the training for logic reasoning and programming skills. System integration is often not covered in computer science curricula. As the embedded platforms migrate from 8-bit microprocessors to 32-bit microprocessors, the engineers require different skills to design modern embedded systems. The Computer Science faculties at several universities in Taiwan have collaborated to design a new course to meet such needs. In this course, we focus on the capability of integrating hardware and software in networked embedded systems. In particular, the students learn the skills for embedded real-time programming, multi-thread programming, low-power network protocols, security, and wireless networks protocol. In this article, we report the design rationale and current status of this course.

The assessment model is based on both a deterministic calculation following the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology in a Danish manual from the Ministry of Transport and on a stochastic calculation, where risk analysis (RA) is carried out using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). After a description of the deterministic and stochastic calculations emphasis is paid to the RA part of CBA-DK with considerations about which probability distributions to make use of. Furthermore, a comprehensive assessment of the set of distributions are made. Finally conclusions and a perspective are presented.

#!A novel algorithm for image segmentation is proposed. The proposed method incorporates geodesic curves and C-V method to raise active contours' performance on image segmentation. Moreover, we extend our method to color images. By practical experiments, it is verified that our model obtains better results than original methods, especially with respect to images within holes, complex background, weak edges, and noise.

#!In this paper, we aim at giving a contribution toward the definition of a UML profile supporting the dependability analysis of real-time and embedded systems (RTES) that conforms to the upcoming profile named "Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems" (MARTE), for which a Request For Proposal has been issued by the Object Management Group (OMG).A set of basic dependability and fault-tolerance concepts need to be included in the profile to support the dependability analysis of RTES. We have exploited the best practices, proposed in the literature, on extending UML with dependability modeling capabilities in order to draw up a check list of requirements to be used as guideline for the definition of a dependability analysis profile. The proposed profile is then applied to the UML design of a case study: a gas turbine control system.

#!Since their introduction as a means of front propagation and their first application to edge-based segmentation in the early 90's, level set methods have become increasingly popular as a general framework for image segmentation. In this paper, we present a survey of a specific class of region-based level set segmentation methods and clarify how they can all be derived from a common statistical framework.Region-based segmentation schemes aim at partitioning the image domain by progressively fitting statistical models to the intensity, color, texture or motion in each of a set of regions. In contrast to edge-based schemes such as the classical Snakes, region-based methods tend to be less sensitive to noise. For typical images, the respective cost functionals tend to have less local minima which makes them particularly well-suited for local optimization methods such as the level set method.We detail a general statistical formulation for level set segmentation. Subsequently, we clarify how the integration of various low level criteria leads to a set of cost functionals. We point out relations between the different segmentation schemes. In experimental results, we demonstrate how the level set function is driven to partition the image plane into domains of coherent color, texture, dynamic texture or motion. Moreover, the Bayesian formulation allows to introduce prior shape knowledge into the level set method. We briefly review a number of advances in this domain.

#!We present a novel interface for directing the actions of computer animated characters and camera movements. Our system takes spoken input in combination with mouse pointing to generate desired character animation based on motion capture data. The aim is to achieve a more natural animation interface by supporting the types of dialogue and pointing that might be used when one person is explaining a desired motion to another person. We compare our voice-driven system with a button-driven animation interface that has equivalent capabilities. An informal user study indicates that for the test scenarios, the voice-user interface (VUI) is faster than an equivalent graphical user interface (GUI). Potential applications include storyboarding for film or theatre, directing characters in video games, and scene reconstruction.

#!Informational logic is a new approach to the formalization of the notion of rational conjecture that is of interest both from the epistemic and the automated reasoning point of view. Given a logical system $T$, an informational logic is based on a new measure of logical information (which is defined on $T$&dash;formulas) and on a mathematical definition of estimate criteria for proofs in $T$. This allows us to obtain a notion of informational theorem $(L,p(L))$ of a system $T$, where $p(L)$ is the probability of $L$ to be provable in $T$. The notion of probability is entirely founded on proof&dash;theoretic concepts. In this paper, informational logic is presented, and applications of this idea to the representation of inductive reasoning and to automated theorem proving are shown.

#!Simulation professionals understand the importance of accurate data for model validation. Traditional sources of simulation data come from information technology systems, manual records from staff, observations, and estimates by subject matter experts.This paper discusses how Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies were used on a recent consulting engagement at a hospital. Data collected through RFID can validate or replace activity duration estimates from traditional sources. However, the accuracy and cost effectiveness of RFID is not guaranteed. A sound methodology was developed, which included rigorous planning and testing of hardware, processes and data analysis.Hardware vendors needed to understand what the simulation required so they could properly setup equipment and software. Also, ED staff needed to understand the purpose of this data collection to avoid anxiety about personnel evaluations. Finally, efficient and reliable issue and collection of patient tags was crucial to the success of this effort.

#!There has been little research into how end users might be able to communicate advice to machine learning systems. If this resource--the users themselves--could somehow work hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, the accuracy of learning systems could be improved and the users' understanding and trust of the system could improve as well. We conducted a think-aloud study to see how willing users were to provide feedback and to understand what kinds of feedback users could give. Users were shown explanations of machine learning predictions and asked to provide feedback to improve the predictions. We found that users had no difficulty providing generous amounts of feedback. The kinds of feedback ranged from suggestions for reweighting of features to proposals for new features, feature combinations, relational features, and wholesale changes to the learning algorithm. The results show that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve machine learning systems, but that learning algorithms need to be extended in several ways to be able to assimilate this feedback.

#!Organizational reformation is inevitable, during the pursuing of larger scales of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In this work, a case study of the pharmaceutical industry in China is presented to show how process-based simulation can be applied to the quantitative studies on the organizational structure reformation. Through modeling core business processes and limited resources in the sales and marketing division of the enterprise, a simulation experiment is performed to analyze how the employees' working hours distribute in daily work. It is found that salesmen only spend 40% working time on the effort of marketing expansion and sales increase. It takes more than half the working time for them to track the progress of logistics affairs. So, it may be concluded that the company in the case should improve the specialization of the organizational design, and especially should consider outsourcing the professional logistics service.

#%236286
#!This paper describes a novel framework used to characterize a J2EE (Java Enterprise Edition) application and develop models of the application by using Java method tracing in a Java-technology based application server. Application servers are critical to large-scale, online servers and serve as middleware to provide secure access to transactional, legacy and web services. The tracing tool in this framework gives a detailed and comprehensive view of the sequences of methods invoked as the application server processes requests. The output of this tool is processed and automatically summarized into a set of transaction profiles which form the input for a simulation model of the application server and its related components. These profiles have proven to be a useful abstraction of the behavior of the transactions processed by the system. After describing the tool and the model, the paper provides results of validation runs and discusses the usefulness of quantitative measurement, analysis and modeling in some areas of system design and system deployment. The models help architects, designers, developers and deployers explore the different facets of performance during all stages of an application's life-cycle, especially during concept development and prototyping.

#!There is an increasing need for the comprehensive simulation of complex, dynamic, physical systems. Often such simulations are built by coupling existing, component models so that their concurrent simulations affect each other. The process of model coupling is, however, a non-trivial task that is not adequately supported by existing frameworks. To provide better support, we have developed an approach to model coupling that uses high level model interfaces called Potential Coupling Interfaces. In this work, we present a visual, domain-specific language for model coupling, called the Coupling Description Language, based on these interfaces. We show that it supports the resolution of model incompatibilities and allows for the fast-prototyping of coupled models.

#!The Ubuntu distribution simplifies Linux by providing a sensible collection of applications, an easy-to-use package manager, and lots of fine-tuning, which make it possibly the best Linux for desktops and laptops. Readers of both Linux Journal and TUX Magazine confirmed this by voting Ubuntu as the best Linux distribution in each publication's 2005 Readers Choice Awards. None of that simplification, however, makes Ubuntu any less fun if you're a hacker or a power user. Like all books in the "Hacks" series, Ubuntu Hacks includes 100 quick tips and tricks for all users of all technical levels. Beginners will appreciate the installation advice and tips on getting the most out of the free applications packaged with Ubuntu, while intermediate and advanced readers will learn the ins-and-outs of power management, wireless roaming, 3D video acceleration, server configuration, and much more.

#index639
#!The Internet is rife with all kinds of creepy PC bugs. In the first six months of 2004, almost 5,000 new Windows viruses and worms were discovered that were capable of compromising computer security. But the pests that users deal with aren't limited to viruses. They're plagued with everything from spam to phishing. But just because your computer is hooked up to the Internet doesn't mean your PC has to be at risk. In a constant battle of one-upmanship, the forces of good have devised a number of creative ways to fend off these Internet nasties in order to best protect your computer. And PC Pest Control from O'Reilly spells out how you can do just that. Written in a friendly, engaging manner, this handy guide covers detection, prevention and cure, where you're vulnerable, and how to surf the web more safely. It also details how you can protect yourself against adware, spyware, home page hijackers, viruses, Trojans, spam, phishing attacks, and more. For easy understanding, PC Pest Control describes each problem and its symptoms, rates the danger level, and then shows you how to solve the problem step by step. In addition, a supporting website keeps the book's content as up to date as possible, so you're always informed of the latest safeguards. And in a field that shifts as frequently as PC protection, that's a major advantage. So if you want to make sure that your personal computer doesn't fall victim to attack-or if your system has already been infected and you want to start anew-then PC Pest Control is most definitely for you.

#!The increasing proliferation of online shopping and purchasing has naturally led to a growth in the popularity of comparison-shopping search engines, popularly known as "shopbots". We extend the one-product-at-a-time search approach used in current shopbot implementations to consider purchasing plans for a bundle of items. Our approach leverages bundle-based pricing and promotional deals frequently offered by online merchants to extract substantial savings. Interestingly, our approach can also identify "freebies" that consumers can obtain at no extra cost. We also develop a model to extend the capability of the current recommendation algorithms that are mainly based on collaborative filtering and item-to-item similarity techniques, to incorporate product price and savings as an additional important factor in making recommendations to shoppers. We develop a practical algorithm that can be employed when the number of items is large or when the real-time nature of shopbot applications dictates quick response rates to consumer queries. A detailed experimental analysis with real-world data from major retailers suggests that the proposed models can provide significant savings for bundle purchasing consumers, and frequently identify freebies for consumers. Together the results underscore the potential benefits that can accrue by incorporating our models into current shopbot systems.

#t1977

#index650
#!In 1973, a project was initiated at Standard Oil of Indiana to investigate future petrochemical raw stock pricing trends. Although large in scope, the project was simple in concept: a mathematical programming model of the domestic refining industry would be subjected to projected future demand patterns for the basic olefinic and aromatic petrochemical intermediates, and the results would be used to predict industry pricing trends. In keeping with the title of this session, I am going to concentrate on the tools used for this study, rather than the study itself or its results. In fact, I could not discuss the results with you, even if I wanted to, because in the first place they are confidential and proprietary to Standard of Indiana and, in the second place, I don't know them. I guess this puts me somewhat in the position of the man who was hauled into court for returning his neighbor's lawnmower in damaged condition. In his defense, he pleaded that "in the first place, I never borrowed his lawnmower, and, in the second place, it was already busted when I picked it up, and, in the third place, it was running fine when I gave it back to him."

#!Motivated by the September 11 attacks, we are addressing the problem of policy analysis of supply-chain security. Considering the potential economic and operational impacts of inspection together with the inherent difficulty of assigning a reasonable cost to an inspection failure call for a policy analysis methodology in which stakeholders can understand the trade-offs between the diverse and potentially conflicting objectives. To obtain this information, we used a simulation-based methodology to characterize the set of Pareto optimal solutions with respect to the multiple objectives represented in the decision problem. Our methodology relies on simulation and the response surface method (RSM) to model the relationships between inspection policies and relevant stakeholder objectives in order to construct a set of Pareto optimal solutions. The approach is illustrated with an application to a real-world supply chain.

#!This paper presents a design toolbox developed for Philips Design in commission of Philips Medical Systems that provides insight into the healthcare context of rural India. Creating products for this context requires an understanding of the needs of the people within it. This paper discusses 'contextual design' through the combination of different descriptive and experiential tools, used to introduce designers into a context they are not familiar with. The toolbox has been evaluated using different performance techniques with design students. The use of role-play techniques has proven increasing relevance in many aspects: increasing the understanding and experience of participants about the context, creating an embodied and common understanding of the ideas being developed and communicating the concepts in their context.

We apply the framework to model student learning during interaction with the Adaptive Coach for Exploration (ACE) learning environment (using both interface and eye-tracking data). In addition to demonstrating framework effectiveness, we also compare results from previous research on applying the framework to a different learning environment and data type. Our results also confirm previous research on the value of using eye-tracking data to assess student learning.

#!A novel fabrication method for LIGA (from the German &#x201c;Lithographie&#x201d;, &#x201c;Galvanik&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Abformung&#x201d;) microneedles with through holes is presented. Such microneedles are in demand by most bio-medical MEMS applications and in some fluidic MEMS applications. We propose a technique that combines conventional deep X-ray lithography, plane-pattern to cross-section transfer (PCT) process, and alignment X-ray lithography. The technique provides precise hole alignment with &#x00b1;&#x00a0;3&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m tolerance. Finite-element simulations on various hole locations were performed to determine the optimum position. We previously fabricated a microneedle with a 100-&#x03bc;m base and a 300-&#x03bc;m height by a right-triangular mask. The resultant microneedle had a very sharp tip but was excessively steep, and thus resulted in a very low strength. Improved strength and tip sharpness was consequently achieved by changing the mask-pattern from a triangular pattern to a polygonal mask and changing the dimensions of the microneedle to have a 300-&#x03bc;m base with various heights between 350 and 800&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m. Using the proposed technique, we could produce a total of 100 hollow microneedles on a 5&#x00a0;&#x00d7;&#x00a0;5&#x00a0;mm2 chip. Moreover, we successfully fabricated sharpened microneedles that were stronger than that we have fabricated so far. The molding process or electroplating and the cost list of the LIGA microneedle will also be included.

#*High-capacity image hiding scheme based on vector quantization
#@Yu-Chen Hu
#t2006
#cPattern Recognition
#index681
#!A novel grayscale image hiding scheme that is capable of hiding multiple secret images into a host image of the same size is proposed in this paper. The secret images to be hidden are first compressed by vector quantization with additional index compression process. Then, the compressed secret images are encrypted and embedded into the least-significant bits of the host pixels. To provide good image quality of the stego-image, the modulus function and the image property are employed to hide the secret bits into the host pixels and determine the number of hidden bits in each host pixel, respectively. According to the results, the proposed scheme provides a higher hiding capacity and a higher degree of security than that of the virtual image cryptosystem.

#!This newest programming guide by bestselling author Jesse Liberty isn't your typical Visual Basic book. It's not a primer on the language, and it won't dull your brain with arguments hyping .NET either. Its goal, rather, is to make you immediately productive, creating Windows and Web applications using Visual Basic and its associated tools. Written for experienced Visual Basic programmers (from either a VB6 or VB .NET background), the book shows how Visual Basic 2005 can be used to rapidly build modern web applications and new "Smart Client" applications, which combine the power of individual computers with network data resources to deliver a rich interactive experience. You'll also learn the details of building robust object-oriented applications, and a host of especially dangerous pitfalls to avoid when programming with Visual Basic 2005. What makes this book different is what's not included. There's no introduction to Visual Basic, no explanation of how it fits into the .NET world. Why waste time reading about something you'll learn for yourself as soon as you start creating applications? You won't even write a "Hello World" program. With Jesse Liberty, you'll get started building something useful. The book is divided into three separate parts--Building Windows Applications, Building Web Applications, and Programming with Visual Basic--each of which could be a book on its own. The author shares his thorough understanding of the subject matter through lucid explanations and intelligently designed lessons that guide you to increasing levels of expertise. By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to program with VB 2005. Jesse Liberty's books have successfully guided thousands of programmers into the world of .NET programming, and Programming Visual Basic 2005 will be no exception. This book is sure to become a key component in the libraries of .NET developers.

#!The Carnegie Mellon In Silico Vox project seeks to move best-quality speech recognition technology from its current software-only form into a range of efficient all-hardware implementations. The central thesis is that, like graphics chips, the application is simply too performance hungry, and too power sensitive, to stay as a large software application. As a first step in this direction, we describe the design and implementation of a fully functional speech-to-text recognizer on a single Xilinx XUP platform. The design recognizes a 1000 word vocabulary, is speaker-independent, recognizes continuous (connected) speech, and is a "live mode" engine, wherein recognition can start as soon as speech input appears. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complex recognizer architecture ever fully committed to a hardware-only form. The implementation is extraordinarily small, and achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art software recognizers, while running at a fraction of the clock speed.

#!We makes use of the LoPC model, which is inspired by both the LogP/PG and BSP models but accounts for contention for message processing resources in parallel programming models to derive a general estimate of execution cost. We carry out this cost estimate analysis for three dominate programming models: message passing, shared memory and distributed shared memory. We analyze a typical application SMV multiplication written in these programming models with irregular receiver-initiated synchronous communication. The LoPC estimate for this application is shown to be reasonably accurate when compared against measured values of runtime of actual empirical computations on an SGI O2000 multiprocessor machine.

#!Emotions are of increasing interest to the HCI community. Within the last decade, emotion research in HCI grew from an eccentric hobby of some visionary scientists to a widely accepted field of research. A number of proof-of-concept prototypes and studies have been published, dedicated sensor systems and technology frameworks have been developed, and theoretical considerations have been made. While they all represent a very valuable contribution to this young field of research, they lack a common theoretical basis. Particularly, there exists no applicable model of emotions suitable for designing emotion-aware systems or performing HCI-related emotion studies. However, in order to become a mature discipline, emotion research in HCI needs such a rigorous footing that future work can be based on. In this paper, a suitable approach to structure and represent emotions for use in digital systems is introduced, after a detailed and critical review of widely used emotion models is given and representative study results are discussed. The proposed method meets several requirements of HCI researchers and software developers. It avoids artificial categorisation of emotions, requires no naming of emotional states, is language independent, and its implementation is straightforward. The results of an experiment based on this approach are discussed demonstrating its applicability.

#!We address the pose mismatch problem which can occur in face verification systems that have only a single (frontal) face image available for training. In the framework of a Bayesian classifier based on mixtures of gaussians, the problem is tackled through extending each frontal face model with artificially synthesized models for non-frontal views. The synthesis methods are based on several implementations of maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), as well as standard multi-variate linear regression (LinReg). All synthesis techniques rely on prior information and learn how face models for the frontal view are related to face models for non-frontal views. The synthesis and extension approach is evaluated by applying it to two face verification systems: a holistic system (based on PCA-derived features) and a local feature system (based on DCT-derived features). Experiments on the FERET database suggest that for the holistic system, the LinReg-based technique is more suited than the MLLR-based techniques; for the local feature system, the results show that synthesis via a new MLLR implementation obtains better performance than synthesis based on traditional MLLR. The results further suggest that extending frontal models considerably reduces errors. It is also shown that the local feature system is less affected by view changes than the holistic system; this can be attributed to the parts based representation of the face, and, due to the classifier based on mixtures of gaussians, the lack of constraints on spatial relations between the face parts, allowing for deformations and movements of face areas.

#!Fusing the scores of several biometric systems is a very promising approach to improve the overall system's accuracy. Despite many works in the literature, it is surprising that there is no coordinated effort in making a benchmark database available. It should be noted that fusion in this context consists not only of multimodal fusion, but also intramodal fusion, i.e., fusing systems using the same biometric modality but different features, or same features but using different classifiers. Building baseline systems from scratch often prevents researchers from putting more efforts in understanding the fusion problem. This paper describes a database of scores taken from experiments carried out on the XM2VTS face and speaker verification database. It then proposes several fusion protocols and provides some state-of-the-art tools to evaluate the fusion performance.

#!Turi (1991) introduced the important notion of a constrained atom&colon; an atom with associated equality and disequality constraints on its arguments. A set of constrained atoms is a constrained interpretation. We investigate how non&dash;ground representations of both the stable model semantics and the well&dash;founded semantics may be obtained through Turi&rsquo;s approach. The practical implication of this is that the well&dash;founded model (or the set of stable models) may be partially pre&dash;computed at compile&dash;time, resulting in the association of each predicate symbol in the program to a constrained atom. Algorithms to create such models are presented, both for the well founded case, and the case of stable models. Query processing reduces to checking whether each atom in the query is true in a stable model (resp. well&dash;founded model). This amounts to showing the atom is an instance of one of some constrained atom whose associated constraint is solvable. Various related complexity results are explored, and the impacts of these results are discussed from the point of view of implementing systems that incorporate the stable and well&dash;founded semantics.

#!This paper proposes a new algorithm to generate a disconnected, three-dimensional (3D) skeleton and an application of such a skeleton to generate a finite element (FE) mesh sizing function of a solid. The mesh sizing function controls the element size and the gradient, and it is crucial in generating a desired FE mesh. Here, a geometry-based mesh sizing function is generated using a skeleton. A discrete skeleton is generated by propagating a wave from the boundary towards the interior on an octree lattice of an input solid model. As the wave propagates, the distance from the boundary and direction of the wave front are calculated at the lattice-nodes (vertices) of the new front. An approximate Euclidean distance metric is used to calculate the distance traveled by the wave. Skeleton points are generated at the region where the opposing fronts meet. The distance at these skeleton points is used to measure both proximity between geometric entities and feature size, and is utilized to generate the mesh size at the lattice-nodes. The proposed octree-based skeleton is more accurate and efficient than traditional voxel-based skeleton and proves to be great tool for mesh sizing function generation.

#!With the development of distributed modeling and simulation, it is necessary for the RTI to support large-scale applications. However, many RTIs can not support largescale distributed simulations with more than 100 federates very well nowadays. StarLink+ is an RTI developed according to the IEEE 1516 standard, which can be used for large-scale simulations with thousands of federates. Great innovations are made in StarLink+, such as its architecture and inner implementation technologies. This paper presents the two-level architecture in StarLink+. The unique architecture has the advantages of both central architecture and distributed architecture. To improve the performance much more for large-scale simulations, two important technologies, i.e. multiple threads and data packing, are adopted in StarLink+. In addition, this paper explains the efficient advancing mechanism in time management and discusses the large-scale experiments with thousands of federates in StarLink+.

This in-depth tutorial not only walks you through the XQuery specification, but also teaches you how to program with this widely anticipated query language.XQuery is for query writers who have some knowledge of XML basics, but not necessarily advanced knowledge of XML-related technologies. It can be used both as a tutorial, by reading cover to cover, and as a reference, by using the comprehensive index and appendixes. Either way, you will find the background knowledge in namespaces, schemas, built-in types and regular expressions that is relevant to writing XML queries. This book provides:A high-level overview and quick tour of XQueryInformation to write sophisticated queries, without being bogged down by the details of types, namespaces, and schemasAdvanced concepts for users who want to take advantage of modularity, namespaces, typing and schemasGuidelines for working with specific types of data, such as numbers, strings, dates, URIs and processing instructionsA complete alphabetical reference to the built-in functions and typesYou will also learn about XQuery's support for filtering, sorting, and grouping data, as well as how to use FLWOR expressions, XPath, and XQuery tools for extracting and combining information. With this book, you will discover how to apply all of these tools to a wide variety of data sources, and how to recombine information from multiple sources into a single final output result.Whether you're coming from SQL, XSLT, or starting from scratch, this carefully paced tutorial takes you through the final 1.0 standard in detail.

#!We consider the problem of congestion-aware multi-path routing in the Internet. Currently, Internet routing protocols select only a single path between a source and a destination. However, due to many policy routing decisions, single-path routing may limit the achievable throughput. In this paper, we envision a scenario where multi-path routing is enabled in the Internet to take advantage of path diversity. Using minimal congestion feedback signals from the routers, we present a class of algorithms that can be implemented at the sources to stably and optimally split the flow between each source-destination pair. We then show that the connection-level throughput region of such multi-path routing/congestion control algorithms can be larger than that of a single-path congestion control scheme.

#!Society today has a wealth of information available due to information technology. The challenge facing researchers working in information access is how to help users easily locate the information needed. Evaluation methodologies and metrics are important tools to assess progress in human information interaction (HII). To properly evaluate these systems, evaluations need to consider the performance of the various components, the usability of the system, and the impact of the system on the end user. Current usability metrics are adequate for evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction of such systems. Performance measures for new intelligent technologies will have to be developed. Regardless of how well the systems are and how usable the systems are, it is critical that impact measures are developed. For HII systems to be useful, we need to assess how well information analysts work with the systems. This evaluation needs to go beyond technical performance metrics and usability metrics. What are the metrics for evaluating utility? This paper describes research efforts focused on developing metrics for the intelligence community that measure the impact of new software to facilitate information interaction.

#!In this paper, we propose a convolution filtering scheme for detecting small defects in low-contrast uniform surface images and, especially, focus on the applications for backlight panels and glass substrates found in liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing. A defect embedded in a low-contrast surface image shows no distinct intensity from its surrounding region, and even worse, the sensed image may present uneven brightness on the surface. All these make the defect detection in low-contrast surface images extremely difficult. In this study, a constrained independent component analysis (ICA) model is proposed to design an optimal filter with the objective that the convolution filter will generate the most representative source intensity of the background surface without noise. The prior constraint incorporated in the ICA model confines the source values of all training image patches of a defect-free image within a small interval of control limits. In the inspection process, the same control parameter used in the constraint is also applied to set up the thresholds that make impulse responses of all pixels in faultless regions within the control limits, and those in defective regions outside the control limits. A stochastic evolutionary computation algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to solve for the constrained ICA model. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can effectively detect small defects in low-contrast backlight panels and LCD glass substrate images.

#!In this paper, the Simbus Backplane is used in conjunction with SAVANT/TyVIS/WARPED, a parallel VHDL simulator, and Xyce, a parallel SPICE simulation engine, to model and simulate a mixed-signal ASIC-driven charging circuit simulation. In particular, the individual components of an airbag deployment system are described and modeled in the digital and analog domains. A VHDL-based microcontroller interface is designed to control an analog charging circuit based on accelerometer output. The accelerometer and charging circuit are modeled in SPICE and interactions between the two domains are established through the Simbus Backplane. The results of this study provide evidence of the implementation possibilities available with a mixed-signal system and demonstrate the feasibility of continuing work in multi-domain simulation.

#!This paper investigates rejection strategies for unconstrained offline handwritten text line recognition. The rejection strategies depend on various confidence measures that are based on alternative word sequences. The alternative word sequences are derived from specific integration of a statistical language model in the hidden Markov model based recognition system. Extensive experiments on the IAM database validate the proposed schemes and show that the novel confidence measures clearly outperform two baseline systems which use normalised likelihoods and local n-best lists, respectively.

#!A variety of techniques for performing a spatial join are reviewed. Instead of just summarizing the literature and presenting each technique in its entirety, distinct components of the different techniques are described and each is decomposed into an overall framework for performing a spatial join. A typical spatial join technique consists of the following components: partitioning the data, performing internal-memory spatial joins on subsets of the data, and checking if the full polygons intersect. Each technique is decomposed into these components and each component addressed in a separate section so as to compare and contrast similar aspects of each technique. The goal of this survey is to describe the algorithms within each component in detail, comparing and contrasting competing methods, thereby enabling further analysis and experimentation with each component and allowing the best algorithms for a particular situation to be built piecemeal, or, even better, enabling an optimizer to choose which algorithms to use.

#!Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities at the metal-bath interface in aluminum reduction cells is an important and not fully understood topic. To simulate the two-fluid three-dimensional unstationary flow subject to a background magnetic field, a level set approach is proposed. It features a formulation in terms of the magnetic vector potential to avoid a numerical growth of the divergence of the magnetic field. The same exact projection scheme (with staggered grids) is used for both the velocity field and the magnetic vector potential. Test simulations show that the overall method behaves well in purely hydrodynamic as well as in fully magnetohydrodynamic regimes, in both cases with a single fluid and with two fluids. We also simulate with our technique the metal pad roll instability and trace the behavior of coupled interracial modes.

#!Despite growing popularity of small-scale clusters built out of off-the-shelf components, there has been little research on how these small-scale clusters behave under different scheduling policies. Batch scheduling policies with backfilling provide excellent space-sharing strategy for parallel jobs. However, as the performances of uniprocessor and symmetric multiprocessor have improved with timesharing scheduling strategies, it is intuitive that the performance of a cluster of PCs with distributed memory may also improve with time-sharing strategies, or a combination of time-sharing and space-sharing strategies. Apart from the batch scheduling policies, this research explores the possibilities of using synchronized time-sharing scheduling algorithms for clusters. This paper describes simulation of the Gang scheduling policies on top of an existing batch scheme. The simulation results indicate that time-sharing scheduler for clusters could exhibit superior performance over a batch policy.

#!As the United States' Army attempts to spiral future force technologies into the current force, realistic representations of network-centric warfare become a priority for modeling and simulation (M&S). Specifically, future communications systems will provide different performance and capabilities than current systems, and these new capabilities need to be represented by the Army's M&S. In order to enable realistic analysis, the new communications systems models will need to be loaded by realistic representations of traffic flows to ensure the accuracy of the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C4ISR) analysis results. This paper will present a design approach and a series of algorithms to implement implicit traffic in the Future Combat Systems (FCS) Simulation Environment (FSE). The paper will focus on a phased approach for the generation of implicit traffic that will realistically load the modeled communications networks as the level of explicit traffic within the simulation environment increases from a small percentage to a large percentage of overall traffic.

#!Using silhouettes in uncontrolled environments typically requires handling occlusions as well as changing or cluttered backgrounds, which limits the applicability of most silhouette based methods. For the purpose of 3-D shape modeling, we show that representing generic 3-D surfaces as implicit surfaces lets us effectively address these issues.This desirable behavior is completely independent from the way the surface deformations are parame-trized. To show this, we demonstrate our technique in three very different cases: Modeling the deformations of a piece of paper represented by an ordinary triangulated mesh; reconstruction and tracking a person's shoulders whose deformations are expressed in terms of Dirichlet Free Form Deformations; reconstructing the shape of a human face parametrized in terms of a Principal Component Analysis model.

#!A central problem in personal communication systems is to optimize bandwidth usage, while providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to mobile users. Network mobility management, and in particular, location management, consumes a significant portion of bandwidth, which is a necessary overhead for supporting mobile users. We focus our efforts on minimizing this overhead. Unlike previous works, we concentrate on optimizing existing schemes, and so the algorithms we present are easily incorporated into current networks. We present the first polynomial time approximation algorithms for minimum bandwidth location management. In planar graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses no more than a constant factor more bandwidth than the optimal solution. In general graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses just a factor O(log n) more bandwidth than optimal where n is the number of base stations in the network. We show that, in practice, our algorithm produces near-optimal results and outperforms other schemes that are described in the literature. For the important case of the line graph, we present a polynomial-time optimal algorithm. Finally, we illustrate that our algorithm can also be used for optimizing the handoff mechanism.

#!We propose a logistic regression method based on the hybridation of a linear model and product-unit neural network models for binary classification. In a first step we use an evolutionary algorithm to determine the basic structure of the product-unit model and afterwards we apply logistic regression in the new space of the derived features. This hybrid model has been applied to seven benchmark data sets and a new microbiological problem. The hybrid model outperforms the linear part and the nonlinear part obtaining a good compromise between them and they perform well compared to several other learning classification techniques. We obtain a binary classifier with very promising results in terms of classification accuracy and the complexity of the classifier.

#!We present an efficient algorithm for approximating huge general volumetric data sets, i.e. the data is given over arbitrarily shaped volumes and consists of up to millions of samples. The method is based on cubic trivariate splines, i.e. piecewise polynomials of total degree three defined w.r.t, uniform type-6 tetrahedral partitions of the volumetric domain. Similar as in the recent bivariate approximation approaches (cf. [10, 15]), the splines in three variables are automatically determined from the discrete data as a result of a two-step method (see [40]), where local discrete least squares polynomial approximations of varying degrees are extended by using natural conditions, i.e. the continuity and smoothness properties which determine the underlying spline space. The main advantages of this approach with linear algorithmic complexity are as follows: no tetrahedral partition of the volume data is needed, only small linear systems have to be solved, the local variation and distribution of the data is automatically adapted, Bernstein-B&eacute;zier techniques well-known in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) can be fully exploited, noisy data are automatically smoothed. Our numerical examples with huge data sets for synthetic data as well as some real-world data confirm the efficiency of the methods, show the high quality of the spline approximation, and illustrate that the rendered iso-surfaces inherit a visual smooth appearance from the volume approximating splines.

#!Medicine, engineering, and finance are traditional fields for the application of Fuzzy Logic (FL); however, in social sciences, the utilization of FL can be intensely explored as a valuable analysis instrument. Joining fuzzy with Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), the natural complex and uncertain criteria of social problems can be adequately explored. A suitable uncertainty analysis is the focal point in the social field. In this direction, an intelligent computational method for election forecasting is proposed as a practical result of this research. The main objective is to present a more flexible methodology for political assessment comparing to traditional methods.

#!A new approach is proposed for reconstructing 3D lines and cameras from 2D corresponding lines across multiple uncalibrated views. There is no requirement that the 2D corresponding lines on different images represent the same segment of a 3D line, which may not appear on all images. A 3D line is reconstructed by minimizing a geometric cost function that measures the distance of the reprojected end points of the 3D segment from the measured 2D lines on different images. An algorithmic procedure is provided with guaranteed convergence to a solution where the geometric cost function achieves a (local) minimum.

#@Barak Raveh,Ofer Rahat,Ronen Basri,Gideon Schreiber

#cBioinformatics
#index888
#!Motivation: Secondary structures are key descriptors of a protein fold and its topology. In recent years, they facilitated intensive computational tasks for finding structural homologues, fold prediction and protein design. Their popularity stems from an appealing regularity in patterns of geometry and chemistry. However, the definition of secondary structures is of subjective nature. An unsupervised de-novo discovery of these structures would shed light on their nature, and improve the way we use these structures in algorithms of structural bioinformatics. Methods: We developed a new method for unsupervised partitioning of undirected graphs, based on patterns of small recurring network motifs. Our input was the network of all H-bonds and covalent interactions of protein backbones. This method can be also used for other biological and non-biological networks. Results: In a fully unsupervised manner, and without assuming any explicit prior knowledge, we were able to rediscover the existence of conventional α-helices, parallel β-sheets, anti-parallel sheets and loops, as well as various non-conventional hybrid structures. The relation between connectivity and crystallographic temperature factors establishes the existence of novel secondary structures.

#!Technology plays an ever-increasing role in our everyday lives. We would like it to be a help rather than a hurdle in our work, particularly in collaborating with others. An emerging problem for both individuals and groups is information spread and neglect, where users have the same copy of the same work, stored on various conventional devices, but no way to keep track of where the most recent version resides. One type of computer support collaborative work application, groupware, tackles this problem, aiming to assist in joint authoring projects, where artifacts such as files, pictures, reports and sound are being gathered to form a whole. Such groupware systems - and we survey seven of them - vary in terms of their functional, architectural, focal, temporal, user involvement and platform dependencies. While we found a wide variety of options for each system, there were also strong commonalities. All of them work with closed communities or groups. There is no public file sharing. All users are aware of all other collaborators in the community and all systems focus on collaboration; not sharing. The comparison includes our own system Nomad, a framework for distributed resource management, with special emphasis placed on the accessibility of information stored on detached devices, such as personal computers, laptops, PDA's and flash-disks. In the comparison, Nomad has advantages of flexibility and temporal independence over the other systems, together with low requirements on the user, and a high level of mobility and platform independence. The contributions of this paper are twofold: we identify and define a specific type of CSCW, groupware, together with a set of criteria for evaluating such systems; and we survey and classify some of the main systems according to the criteria, as well as introducing a custom-designed system, Nomad. From these results, a collaborative group of workers can more easily select a specific groupware that suits its needs. Moreover, designers of new systems will find the commonality factors useful, so they can more easily position their own products.

#!In this paper, we propose a novel variational method for color image segmentation using modified geodesic active contour method. Our goal is to detect Object(s) of Interest (OOI) from a given color image, regardless of other objects. The main novelty of our method is that we modify the stopping function in the functional of usual geodesic active contour method so that the new stopping function is coupled by a discrimination function of OOI. By minimizing the functional, the OOI is segmented. Firstly, we study the pixel properties of the OOI by sample pixels visually chosen from OOI. From these sample pixels, by the principal component analysis and interval estimation, the discrimination function of whether a pixel is in the OOI is obtained probabilistically. Then we propose the energy functional for the segmentation of OOI with new stopping function. Unlike usual stopping functions defined by the image gradient, our improved stopping function depends on not only the image gradient but also the discrimination function derived from the color information of OOI. As a result, better than usual active contour methods which detect all objects in the image, our modified active contour method can detect OOI but without unwanted objects. Experiments are conducted in both synthetic and natural images. The result shows that our algorithm is very efficient for detecting OOI even the background is complicated.

#!We study the problem of image retrieval based on semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Different from traditional supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning makes use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In image retrieval, collecting labeled examples costs human efforts, while vast amounts of unlabeled data are often readily available and offer some additional information. In this paper, based on support vector machine (SVM), we introduce a semi-supervised learning method for image retrieval. The basic consideration of the method is that, if two data points are close to each, they should share the same label. Therefore, it is reasonable to search a projection with maximal margin and locality preserving property. We compare our method to standard SVM and transductive SVM. Experimental results show efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

#!Soaring health care costs and greater emphasis on preventative medicine have compelled researchers to examine new ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency in outpatient services. Extended waiting times for treatment in the outpatient department followed by short consultations has long been a complaint of patients. This issue is becoming increasingly important in Japan with its progressively aging society. In this context, a discrete event simulation model was developed to examine doctor schedule mixes (DSMs) and various appointment schedules (ASs) in a mixed-patient type environment in an outpatient department of internal medicine of a university hospital. It could identify some of the best DSMs by integrating a simulation model into an optimization program. Combining one DSM found via an optimization program with some ASs, the patient waiting time could be reduced drastically without adding extra resources.

#!In the weak form Galerkin formulation for incompressible flows, the pressure has a well-understood role. At all times, it may be interpreted as a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the divergence-free constraint on the velocity field. This is not the case in least-squares formulations for incompressible flows, where the divergence-free constraint is enforced in a least-squares sense in a variational setting of residual minimization. Thus, the role of the pressure in a least-squares formulation is rather vague. We find that this lack of velocity-pressure coupling in least-squares formulations may induce spurious temporal pressure oscillations when using the non-stationary form of the equations. We present a least-squares formulation with improved velocity-pressure coupling, based on the use of a regularized divergence-free constraint. A first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) approach based on velocity, pressure and vorticity is used to allow the use of practical C0 element expansions in the finite element model. We use high-order spectral element expansions in space and second- and third-order time stepping schemes. Excellent conservation of mass and accuracy of computed pressure metrics are demonstrated in the numerical results.

#cIEICE - Transactions on Information and Systems
#index930
#!In this paper, we propose a new region extraction method using chroma key with a two-tone checker pattern background. The method solves the problem in conventional chroma key techniques that foreground objects become transparent if their colors are the same as the background color. The method utilizes the adjacency condition between two-tone regions of the background and the geometrical information of the background grid line. The procedure of the proposed method consists of four steps: 1) background color extraction, 2) background grid line extraction, 3) foreground extraction, and 4) image composition. As to background color extraction, a color space approach is used. As to background grid line extraction, it is difficult to extract background grid line by a color space approach because the color of this region may be a composite of two background colors and different from them. Therefore, the background grid line is extracted from adjacency conditions between two background colors. As to foreground extraction, the boundary between the foreground and the background is detected to recheck the foreground region whose color is same as the background, and the background region whose color is same as the foreground. To detect regions whose colors are same as the background, the adjacency conditions with the background grid line are utilized. As to image composition, the process that smoothes the color of the foreground's boundary against the new background is carried out to create natural images. Experimental results show that the foreground objects can be segmented exactly from the background regardless of the colors of the foreground objects.

#!The PDES literature offers a rich set of techniques for distributed and efficient simulation. However, there is a growing need for simulators that support agent-based applications, and PDES systems are not always well suited for these applications. Example agent-based applications include simulation of biological systems such as ants and bees, multi-robot systems and battlefield simulations. The robotics research community has developed agent-based simulators that provide useful APIs for agent applications. However, such simulators have performance limitations, and they do not scale well. Our approach is to provide middleware between an agent-based API and a PDES simulation kernel. The result is a simulation system that offers an agent-based API for the programmer to a high performance PDES system. Here we describe our design and initial implementation of SASSY, the Scalable Agents Simulation System. We describe our initial implementation and compare the design with related approaches.

#!This paper presents a Time Warp fossil collection mechanism that functions without need for a GVT estimation algorithm. Effectively each Logical Process (LP) collects causality information during normal event execution and then each LP utilizes this information to identify fossils. In this mechanism, LPs use constant size vectors (that are independent of the total number of parallel simulation objects) as timestamps called Plausible Total Clocks to disseminate causality information. For proper operation, this mechanism requires that the communication layer preserves a FIFO ordering on messages. A detailed description of this new fossil collection mechanism and its proof of correctness is presented in this paper.

#!A simple and general-purpose system to recognize biological particles is presented. It is composed of four stages: First (if necessary) promising locations in the image are detected and small regions containing interesting samples are extracted using a feature finder. Second, differential invariants of the brightness are computed at multiple scales of resolution. Third, after point-wise non-linear mappings to a higher dimensional feature space, this information is averaged over the whole region thus producing a vector of features for each sample that is invariant with respect to rotation and translation. Fourth, each sample is classified using a classifier obtained from a mixture-of-Gaussians generative model. This system was developed to classify 12 categories of particles found in human urine; it achieves a 93.2% correct classification rate in this application. It was subsequently trained and tested on a challenging set of images of airborne pollen grains where it achieved an 83% correct classification rate for the three categories found during one month of observation. Pollen classification is challenging even for human experts and this performance is considered good.

#!Motivation: Functional analyses based on the association of Gene Ontology (GO) terms to genes in a selected gene list are useful bioinformatic tools and the GOstats package has been widely used to perform such computations. In this paper we report significant improvements and extensions such as support for conditional testing. Results: We discuss the capabilities of GOstats, a Bioconductor package written in R, that allows users to test GO terms for over or under-representation using either a classical hypergeometric test or a conditional hypergeometric that uses the relationships among GO terms to decorrelate the results. Availability: GOstats is available as an R package from the Bioconductor project: http://bioconductor.org Contact: sfalcon@fhcrc.org

#!The synthesis of increased global competitiveness and the acceptance of commercially available multi purpose database management systems (DBMS) for decision support applications requires an ever more critical system evaluation and selection to be completed in a progressively short period of time. Designers of standard benchmarks, individual customer benchmarks and system stress tests alike are struggling to mastermind queries that are both representative to the real world and execute in a reasonable time. Additionally, the enriched functionality of every new DBMS release amplifies the complexity of today's decision support systems calling for a novel approach in query generation for benchmarks. This paper proposes a framework of so called query evolution rules that can be applied to typical decision support queries, written in SQL92. Deployed in combination with QGEN2, the query generator developed by the TPC for TPC-DS ?[13], these rules quickly turn a small set of queries into a large set of semantically similar queries for ad-hoc benchmarking purposes or they can be used to generate thousands of queries quickly to stress test optimizers or query execution engines without much user intervention.

Initially most effort was directed at building the host processor, EMMY, and its support tools. The next stage was to emulate a variety of instruction sets --- building an archive of emulators. Now we have well over a dozen emulators and can add a new one quickly. A student can emulate a know image architecture in about ten weeks --- twenty weeks includes verification and documentation --- thirty weeks for I/O and interface to a simple operating system. (A student-week is about 6 - 8 hours of effort and corresponds to three units of credit.)

#*A new metric for measuring metamodels quality-of-fit for deterministic simulations

#!Metamodels are used to provide simpler prediction means than the complex simulation models they approximate. Accuracy of a metamodel is one fundamental criterion that is used as the basis for accepting or rejecting a metamodel. Average-based metrics such as root-mean-square error RMSE and R-square are often used. Like all other average-based statistics, these measures are sensitive to sample sizes unless the number of test points in these samples is adequate. We introduce in this paper a new metric that can be used to measure metamodels fit quality, called metamodel acceptability score MAS. The proposed metric gives readily interpretable meaning to metamodels acceptability. Furthermore, initial studies show that MAS is less sensitive to test sample sizes compared to average-based validation measures.

#!Automatic creation of B-rep models of engineering objects from freehand sketches would benefit designers. A subgoal is to take a single line drawing (with hidden lines removed), and from it deduce an initial 3D geometric realisation of the visible part of the object. Junction and line labels, and provisional depth coordinates, are important components of this frontal geometry. Most methods for producing frontal geometry use line labelling, but this takes little or no account of geometry. As a result, the line labels produced can be unreliable.Previously, we proposed an approach which inflates a drawing to produce provisional depth coordinates, and uses these to make deductions about line labels. Even a na&iuml;ve implementation can outperform previous line labelling methods in certain cases. In this paper, we further enhance this approach. We extend the algorithm to non-isometric-projection drawings, consider improved ways of realising some of the concepts, and also consider how to combine this approach with other labelling techniques to gain the benefits of each.We test our approach using to be drawings of what we consider representative samples of engineering objects; these exemplify difficulties not considered in many previous papers on line labelling. Our results, based on this test set, show that the enhancements result in significant benefits.

#!The most recent advances in external bone remodeling are shown using strain energy density (SED) and damage mechanics variables as stimulus functions. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is used to obtain the tractions and displacements in each iteration.In this paper it is assumed that the level of damage and the strain energy near the periosteum and endosteum control the external bone remodeling response in the cortical of long bones. The boundary is modified as a function of time and the numerical analysis is solved through the method before mentioned for each variation of the boundary coordinates, then the geometry is evaluated and adapted. Smoothing techniques are used ([β-spline surfaces) to prevent sudden variations in the boundary that may hinder a solution convergence. To validate this model a numerical example is shown with previously validated experimental data from other authors.

#!We present a novel approach for interactively synthesizing motions for characters navigating in complex environments. We focus on the runtime efficiency for motion generation, thereby enabling the interactive animation of a large number of characters simultaneously. The key idea is to precompute search trees of motion clips that can be applied to arbitrary environments. Given a navigation goal relative to a current body position, the best available solution paths and motion sequences can be efficiently extracted during runtime through a series of table lookups. For distant start and goal positions, we first use a fast coarse-level planner to generate a rough path of intermediate sub-goals to guide each iteration of the runtime lookup phase.We demonstrate the efficiency of our technique across a range of examples in an interactive application with multiple autonomous characters navigating in dynamic environments. Each character responds in real-time to arbitrary user changes to the environment obstacles or navigation goals. The runtime phase is more than two orders of magnitude faster than existing planning methods or traditional motion synthesis techniques. Our technique is not only useful for autonomous motion generation in games, virtual reality, and interactive simulations, but also for animating massive crowds of characters offline for special effects in movies.

#!Given a sequence of n real numbers and an integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1/2n(n - 1), the k maximum-sum segments problem is to locate the k segments whose sums are the k largest among all possible segment sums. Recently, Bengtsson and Chen gave an O(min{k + n log2 n, n√k})-time algorithm for this problem. Bae and Takaoka later proposed a more efficient algorithm for small k. In this paper, we propose an O(n + k log(min{n, k}))-time algorithm for the same problem, which is superior to both of them when k is o(n log n). We also give the first optimal algorithm for delivering the k maximum-sum segments in non-decreasing order if k ≤ n. Then we develop an O(n2d-1 + k log min{n, k})-time algorithm for the d-dimensional version of the problem, where d > 1 and each dimension, without loss of generality, is of the same size n. This improves the best previously known O(n2d-1C)-time algorithm, also by Bengtsson and Chen, where C = min{k + n log2 n, n√k}. It should be pointed out that, given a two-dimensional array of size m × n, our algorithm for finding the k maximum-sum subarrays is the first one achieving cubic time provided that k is O(m2n/log n).

#!A re-scan of the well-known Mach band illusion has led to the proposal of a Bi-Laplacian of Gaussian operation in early vision. Based on this postulate, the human visual system at low-level has been modeled from two approaches that give rise to two new tools. On one hand, it leads to the construction of a new image sharpening kernel, and on the other, to the explanation of more complex brightness-contrast illusions and the possible development of a new algorithm for robust visual capturing and display systems.

#!Use different real positive numbers p"i to represent all kinds of pattern categories, after mapping the inputted patterns into a special feature space by a non-linear mapping, a linear relation between the mapped patterns and numbers p"i is assumed, whose bias and coefficients are undetermined, and the hyper-plane corresponding to zero output of the linear relation is looked as the base hyper-plane. To determine the pending parameters, an objective function is founded aiming to minimize the difference between the outputs of the patterns belonging to a same type and the corresponding p"i, and to maximize the distance between any two different hyper-planes corresponding to different pattern types. The objective function is same to that of support vector regression in form, so the coefficients and bias of the linear relation are calculated by some known methods such as SVM^l^i^g^h^t approach. Simultaneously, three methods are also given to determine p"i, the best one is to determine them in training process, which has relatively high accuracy. Experiment results of the IRIS data set show that, the accuracy of this method is better than those of many SVM-based multi-class classifiers, and close to that of DAGSVM (decision-directed acyclic graph SVM), emphatically, the recognition speed is the highest.

#!The growth of different network architectures to connect wireless sensors for monitoring physical environments has become an important application area. Chief issues related to such systems include: (a) the permanence of environment monitoring, (b) the mobility management of sensors, (c) the adhoc communication method, and (d) the security of responsive messages. This paper presents an ad-hoc architecture and communication and mobility schemes to offer an efficient monitoring system in an environment where targets have unpredicted motion. Moreover, it introduces a security solution. The paper concludes by presenting the simulation results in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

#!The realistic simulation modeling becomes very essential and effective for designing and managing of manufacturing systems, which needs to be addressed manufacturing dynamics. This research includes manufacturing uncertainties in the form of simulation intelligence to improve the system's performance in the high-mix low-volume manufacturing systems. It shows how simulation modeling can be used to evaluate alternative designs in a dynamic uncertain manufacturing environment. Fuzzy rule based machine, labor and logistics uncertainties are addressed in this study. A combination of product mix and production volume is analyzed using intelligent simulation model for an optimal designing of the production system to meet future customer demands. Intelligent knowledge system shows significant close to real-life scenario. The proposed intelligent simulation modeling is validated with real life application.

#!This IBM Redbook provides an introduction to the IBM SOA Foundation, and includes a detailed implementation example for the Service Creation scenario. Part 1. "Getting started with IBM SOA Foundation,” includes an introduction to SOA from a business and architecture perspective. We describe the key elements of the IBM SOA Foundation, including the SOA life cycle, logical architecture, and SOA scenarios. Next we describe the Service Creation scenario in more detail since this is the focus of redbook example. We describe best practices and guidelines for SOA. In addition, we include a process for applying the SOA scenarios and patterns. Part 2 "Service Creation scenario example,” provides an end-to-end working example representative of the Service Creation scenario. We start by modeling the business requirements of a fictitious car rental company that has an existing J2EE based application. We demonstrate how to identify services using SOMA, and use a process for applying the SOA scenarios and reusable patterns to accelerate the creation of a solution architecture. The remaining chapters provide the implementation details to assemble using Rational Application Developer V6.0.1, deploy using WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment V6.0.2, and manage the solution using Tivoli Composite Application Manager for SOA V6.0.

#!Member-maintained communities ask their users to perform tasks the community needs. From Slashdot, to IMDb, to Wikipedia, groups with diverse interests create community-maintained artifacts of lasting value (CALV) that support the group's main purpose and provide value to others. Said communities don't help members find work to do, or do so without regard to individual preferences, such as Slashdot assigning meta-moderation randomly. Yet social science theory suggests that reducing the cost and increasing the personal value of contribution would motivate members to participate more.We present SuggestBot, software that performs intelligent task routing (matching people with tasks) in Wikipedia. SuggestBot uses broadly applicable strategies of text analysis, collaborative filtering, and hyperlink following to recommend tasks. SuggestBot's intelligent task routing increases the number of edits by roughly four times compared to suggesting random articles. Our contributions are: 1) demonstrating the value of intelligent task routing in a real deployment; 2) showing how to do intelligent task routing; and 3) sharing our experience of deploying a tool in Wikipedia, which offered both challenges and opportunities for research.

They know the fastest, smartest, and most efficient way to do just about everything. In short, they know all the "tricks of the trade." And now, you can too.This book is packed cover-to-cover, wall-to-wall with nothing but those cool little inside tips that can make you faster, better, and have more fun using Adobe InDesign CS2. There are no detailed descriptions on working with hyphenation dictionaries, or long boring discussions on color workflow, it's just tips--short, sweet, and to the point.So why just tips? When we (you, me, etc.) look at books, if we see the word "Tip" we're all immediately drawn to it. That's because we know we're about to learn something really cool. Maybe it's an undocumented keyboard shortcut, a hidden inside secret, or just a faster, better way to do something we do every day. The only problem with the tips in these books is there's never enough of 'em. That is, until now.We wanted to create a book that is nothing but these tips, hundreds of tips, but with the added bonus that each tip would have a full color graphic along with it, showing you exactly how it's done. Most importantly, to get in this book they've got to be "Killer Tips." The kind of tip that makes you smile, nod, and then call all your friends and "tune them up" with your new status as InDesign guru.This book is your ticket to working faster and smarter in Adobe InDesign CS2 than you ever thought you could, and best of all, you'll have a blast doing it.

#!Many factors currently influence the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) workforce, including the drive for return to flight, a stated Shuttle Program end date of 2010, and the Vision for Space Exploration which calls for the development of a new launch vehicle. Additionally, external factors such as cost of living in Central Florida, availability of skilled technical hires, and unemployment rate affect the overall workforce climate. Managing human capital in a manner consistent with safety and mission success, and to strategically position the center to execute its future mission, it is necessary to understand how these different influencing factors work together to produce an overall workforce climate. We have been using System Dynamics models to capture some of these factors. These models are also the starting point of agent-based models which can capture particular features not possible with the original system dynamics models. This paper introduces our simulation modeling efforts.

#!Motion capture data is now widely available to create realistic character animation. However, it is difficult to reuse without any additional information. For this reason, annotating motion data with kinematic constraints is a clever step to ease further operations such as blending or motion editing. Unfortunately, prior automatic methods prove to be unreliable for noisy data and/or lack genericity. In this paper, we present a method for detecting kinematic constraints for motion data. It detects when an object (or an end-effector) is stationary in space or is rotating around an axis or a point. Our method is fast, generic and may be used on any kind of objects in the scene. Furthermore, it is robust to highly noisy data as we detect and reject aberrant data by using a least median of squares (LMedS) method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method in various motion editing contexts.

#!Valid models of the WWW are important for creating WWW-like representations, upon which new algorithms and applications for searching, indexing, compression etc. can be tested, but also for predicting the evolution of the web and the emergence of important new phenomena. In this study we introduce a validation process for web-graph models and use it to analyze the behavior of the Exponential Growth Copying Model, which has been explicitly designed to model the WWW. We study the effect of individual parameters on its effectiveness, suggest appropriate parameter values for the creation of web-like graphs and indicate inherent deficiencies of the model.

#!WDM optical networks provide unprecedented high speed and reliability for message transfer among the nodes. All-to-all routing is a fundamental routing problem in such networks and has been well studied on single hop WDM networks. However, the number of wavelengths to realize all-to-all routing on the single hop model typically is very large. One way to reduce the number of wavelengths is to use k-hop routing, in which each routing path consists of k segments and each segment is assigned a different wavelength, where k usually is a small constant. Because of the complexity of design and analysis for such a routing problem, only few papers discussed and proposed all-to-all routing by k ≥ 2 hops. However, the proposed algorithms are usually exceeding complicated even for ring topologies. Often, an ad hoc approach is employed to deal with each individual topology.In this paper we propose a generic method for all-to-all routing in multi-hop WDM networks, which aims to minimize the number of wavelengths. We illustrate the approach for several optical networks of commonly used topology, including lines, rings, tori, meshes, and complete binary trees. For each case an upper bound on the number of wavelengths is obtained. The results show that this approach produces clear routing paths, requires less wavelengths, and can easily incorporate load balancing. For simple topologies such as lines and rings, this approach easily produces the same bounds on the number of wavelengths that were hard-obtained previously. Moreover, this general approach provides a unified routing algorithm for any d-dimensional torus, which seems impossible to obtain by the previous approach.

#!This paper presents a new and powerful heterogeneous solid modeling paradigm for representing, modeling, and rendering of multi-dimensional, physical attributes across any volumetric objects. The modeled solid can be of complicated geometry and arbitrary topology. It is formulated using a trivariate simplex spline defined over a tetrahedral decomposition of any 3D domain. Heterogeneous material attributes associated with solid geometry can be modeled and edited by manipulating the control vectors and/or associated knots of trivariate simplex splines easily. The multiresolution capability is achieved by interactively subdividing any regions of interest and allocating more knots and control vectors accordingly. We also develop a feature-sensitive fitting algorithm that can reconstruct a more compact, continuous trivariate simplex spline from structured or unstructured volumetric grids. This multiresolution representation results from the adaptive and progressive tetrahedralization of the 3D domain. In addition, based on the simplex spline theory, we derive several theoretical formula and propose a fast direct rendering algorithm for interactive data analysis and visualization of the simplex spline volumes. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm augments the current modeling and visualization techniques with the new and unique advantages.

#!To make the best use of the resources in a shared grid environment, an application scheduler must make a prediction of available performance on each resource. In this paper, we examine the problem of predicting available CPU performance in time-shared grid system. We present and evaluate a new and innovative method to predict the one-step-ahead CPU load in a grid. Our prediction strategy forecasts the future CPU load based on the variety tendency in several past steps and in previous similar patterns, and uses a polynomial fitting method. Our experimental results on large load traces collected from four different kinds of machines demonstrate that this new prediction strategy achieves average prediction errors which are between 22% and 86% less than those incurred by four previous methods.

#!This paper presents simple and deterministic algorithms for partial point set pattern matching in 2D. Given a set P of n points, called sample set, and a query set Q of k points (n>=k), the problem is to find a matching of Q with a subset of P under rigid motion. The match may be of two types: exact and approximate. If an exact matching exists, then each point in Q coincides with the corresponding point in P under some translation and/or rotation. For an approximate match, some translation and/or rotation may be allowed such that each point in Q lies in a predefined @e-neighborhood region around some point in P. The proposed algorithm for the exact matching needs O(n^2) space and O(n^2logn) preprocessing time. The existence of a match for a given query set Q can be checked in O(k@alogn) time in the worst-case, where @a is the maximum number of equidistant pairs of point in P. For a set of n points, @a may be O(n^4^/^3) in the worst-case. Some applications of the partial point set pattern matching are then illustrated. Experimental results on random point sets and some fingerprint databases show that, in practice, the computation time is much smaller than the worst-case requirement. The algorithm is then extended for checking the exact match of a set of k line segments in the query set with a k-subset of n line segments in the sample set under rigid motion in O(knlogn) time. Next, a simple version of the approximate matching problem is studied where one point of Q exactly matches with a point of P, and each of the other points of Q lie in the @e-neighborhood of some point of P. The worst-case time and space complexities of the proposed algorithm are O(n^2k^2logn) and O(n), respectively. The proposed algorithms will find many applications to fingerprint matching, image registration, and object recognition.

#!In this paper, we describe the compiler developed to target the Molen reconfigurable processor and programming paradigm. The compiler automatically generates optimized binary code for C applications, based on pragma annotation of the code executed on the reconfigurable hardware. For the IBM PowerPC 405 processor included in the Virtex II Pro platform FPGA, we implemented code generation, register, and stack frame allocation following the PowerPC EABI (embedded application binary interface). The PowerPC backend has been extended to generate the appropriate instructions for the reconfigurable hardware and data transfer, taking into account the information of the specific hardware implementations and system. Starting with an annotated C application, a complete design flow has been integrated to generate the executable bitstream for the reconfigurable processor. The flexible design of the proposed infrastructure allows to consider the special features of the reconfigurable architectures. In order to hide the reconfiguration latencies, we implemented an instruction-scheduling algorithm for the dynamic hardware configuration instructions. The algorithm schedules, in advance, the hardware configuration instructions, taking into account the conflicts for the reconfigurable hardware resources (FPGA area) between the hardware operations. To verify the Molen compiler, we used the multimedia video frame M-JPEG encoder of which the extended discrete cosine transform (DCT&ast;) function was mapped on the FPGA. We obtained an overall speedup of 2.5 (about 84&percnt; efficiency over the maximal theoretical speedup of 2.96). The performance efficiency is achieved using automatically generated nonoptimized DCT&ast; hardware implementation. The instruction-scheduling algorithm has been tested for DCT, quantization, and VLC operations. Based on simulation results, we determine that, while a simple scheduling produces a significant performance decrease, our proposed scheduling contributes for up to 16x M-JPEG encoder speedup.

#!Many military planning problems are difficult to solve using pure mathematical programming techniques. One such problem is scheduling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military operations subject to dynamic movement and control constraints. This problem is instead formulated as a dynamic programming problem whose approximate solution is obtained via the Assignment Scheduling Capability for UAVs (ASC-U) model using concepts from both simulation and optimization. Optimization is very effective at identifying the best decision for static problems, but is weaker in identifying the best decision in dynamic systems. Simulation is very effective in modeling and capturing dynamic effects, but is weak in optimizing from alternatives. ASC-U exploits the relative strengths of both methodologies by periodically re-optimizing UAV assignments and then having the simulation transition the states according to state dynamics. ASC-U thus exploits the strengths of simulation and optimization to construct good, timely solutions that neither optimization nor simulation could achieve alone.

#!This paper considers the problem that arises when a vehicle carrying nuclear material is detected approaching a border crossing. As quickly as possible, and with automation we wish to identify which vehicle among all those in the area is likely to be carrying the source. We show that if the border crossing area has technology for tracking the position of vehicles, we can correlate observed movements with observed changes in levels of detected radiation---for as the vehicle carrying the material gets closer to the detector, the stronger will be the detected radiation. We use a simulation model that captures the stop-and-go dynamics of a border crossing area to evaluate our ideas, and find a highly successful technique that tracks which vehicles move just when detected radiation changes, coupled with fitting radiation intensity/distance observations to an inverse-square law. This method almost always isolates the sought vehicle just as soon as the minimum number of data observations is obtained.

#!Many databases contain uncertain and imprecise references to real-world entities. The absence of identifiers for the underlying entities often results in a database which contains multiple references to the same entity. This can lead not only to data redundancy, but also inaccuracies in query processing and knowledge extraction. These problems can be alleviated through the use of entity resolution. Entity resolution involves discovering the underlying entities and mapping each database reference to these entities. Traditionally, entities are resolved using pairwise similarity over the attributes of references. However, there is often additional relational information in the data. Specifically, references to different entities may cooccur. In these cases, collective entity resolution, in which entities for cooccurring references are determined jointly rather than independently, can improve entity resolution accuracy. We propose a novel relational clustering algorithm that uses both attribute and relational information for determining the underlying domain entities, and we give an efficient implementation. We investigate the impact that different relational similarity measures have on entity resolution quality. We evaluate our collective entity resolution algorithm on multiple real-world databases. We show that it improves entity resolution performance over both attribute-based baselines and over algorithms that consider relational information but do not resolve entities collectively. In addition, we perform detailed experiments on synthetically generated data to identify data characteristics that favor collective relational resolution over purely attribute-based algorithms.

#!In fingerprint verification systems, there are usually multiple (from two to four) enrolled impressions for a same finger. The performance of the systems can be improved by combining these impressions through feature fusion or decision fusion strategy. In this paper, different schemes to combine multiple enrolled impressions are comparatively studied. Experimental results show that a larger improvement can be obtained by using decision fusion scheme than feature fusion. In all decision fusion rules, sum rule outperforms voting rule a little whether using similarity or Neyman-Pearson rule. Based on the observation that the performance of these two strategies can complement each other, we also propose a novel fusion scheme to further combine feature fusion and decision fusion, which can produce an even better result.

#!This paper presents a connection handoff interface between the operating system and the network interface. Using this interface, the operating system can offload a subset of TCP connections in the system to the network interface, while the remaining connections are processed on the host CPU. Offloading can reduce computation and memory bandwidth requirements for packet processing on the host CPU. However, full TCP offloading may degrade system performance because finite processing and memory resources on the network interface limit the amount of packet processing and the number of connections. Using handoff, the operating system controls the number of offloaded connections in order to fully utilize the network interface without overloading it. Handoff is transparent to the application, and the operating system may choose to offload connections to the network interface or reclaim them from the interface at any time. A prototype system based on the modified FreeBSD operating system shows that handoff reduces the number of instructions and cache misses on the host CPU. As a result, the number of CPU cycles spent processing each packet decreases by 16--84%. Simulation results show handoff can improve web server throughput (SEPCweb99) by 15%, despite short-lived connections.

The differences between these groups translate into specific network requirements. Within some organizations, these requirements are so dissimilar that the different groups need to be treated as totally separate customers by the enterprise's IT department. As the number of groups increases, keeping them separate and secure is a challenge to IT departments, particularly with the advent of wireless networks, the requirement for enterprise-wide user mobility, and the need for cross group collaboration with resource sharing on a per project basis. Network Virtualization provides design guidance for virtualized enterprise networks and arms network architects with the background necessary to make sound technological choices in the face of different business requirements. As a means of introduction, Network Virtualization lays out the fundamentals of enterprise network design. The book builds upon these fundamental principles to introduce the different virtualization methods as the logical evolution of the enterprise network architecture. Detailed descriptions of the technology, design principles, network configurations, and real-world case studies are provided throughout the book, helping readers develop a pragmatic understanding of virtualized enterprise network architectures. Specific examples are included that tailor deployment advice to the small, medium, and large enterprise environment.

#!Fusion of sensor and communication data currently can only be performed at a late processing stage after sensor and textual information are formulated as logical statements at appropriately high level of abstraction. Contrary to this it seems, the human mind integrates sensor and language signals seamlessly, before signals are understood, at pre-conceptual level. Learning of conceptual contents of the surrounding world depends on language and vice versa. The paper describes a mathematical technique for such integration. It combines fuzzy dynamic logic with dual cognitive-language models. The paper briefly discusses relationships between the proposed mathematical technique, working of the mind and applications to understanding-based search engines.

#!Based on the recently published point symmetry distance (PSD) measure, this paper presents a novel PSD measure, namely symmetry similarity level (SSL) operator for K-means algorithm. Our proposed modified point symmetry-based K-means (MPSK) algorithm is more robust than the previous PSK algorithm by Su and Chou. Not only the proposed MPSK algorithm is suitable for the symmetrical intra-clusters as the PSK algorithm does, the proposed MPSK algorithm is also suitable for the symmetrical inter-clusters. In addition, two speedup strategies are presented to reduce the time required in the proposed MPSK algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the significant execution-time improvement and the extension to the symmetrical inter-clusters of the proposed MPSK algorithm when compared to the previous PSK algorithm.

#!Computer simulation models will ideally be developed within an environment where all the necessary input data is readily available and all the relevant stakeholders are supportive and co-operative. In practice, many models are developed for the purpose of evaluating organisational or process change. As a result, system performance data may often be limited or potentially biased by key parties associated with the results of the simulation model. Ensuring valid input data is therefore a key aspect of model validation and an important component in a successful simulation study. This paper addresses some examples of data collection problems that have been encountered by the author and presents a number of lessons identified.

#!A remote user authentication scheme is a two-party protocol whereby an authentication server in a distributed system confirms the identity of a remote individual logging on to the server over an untrusted, open network. Recently, Lee et al. have proposed an efficient nonce-based scheme for remote user authentication using smart cards. This work reviews Lee et al.'s authentication scheme and provides a security analysis on the scheme. Our analysis shows that Lee et al.'s scheme does not achieve its basic aim of authenticating remote users and furthermore has a very hazardous method for changing passwords. In addition, we recommend some changes to the scheme so that it can attain at least its main security goal.

#!Intel's Fab-18 is based in Israel, and has transitioned from producing 0.18-micron logic devices to producing 90nM flash products. During this transition period, the factory has de-ramped in volume of logic while ramping-up flash. AutoSched AP software was utilized for the development of a transient simulation model of the Fab's behavior during this period. It is the first attempt, at Intel, to utilize a full factory simulation in order to analyze and support decisions that pertain to a transient period of parallel de-ramp and ramp-up of technologies. Unlike typical simulation models for the analysis of factory performance and behavior in steady-state, the transient model poses several modeling challenges and requires major adjustments in dealing with these challenges. In this paper, we discuss those aspects. The benefits and contribution of such a model to decision making and the improvement of factory performance are also presented.

#!In many real-world optimization problems, the objective function may come from a simulation evaluation so that it is (a) subject to various levels of noise, (b) not differentiable, and (c) computationally hard to evaluate. In this paper, we modify Powell's UOBYQA algorithm to handle those real-world simulation problems. Our modifications apply Bayesian techniques to guide appropriate sampling strategies to estimate the objective function. We aim to make the underlying UOBYQA algorithm proceed efficiently while simultaneously controlling the amount of computational effort.

With the wide use of ontologies their integration, design, and evolution becomes an important problem. We show how textmining on relevant text corpora can be used to identify matching ontology terms of two separate ontologies and to propose new ontology terms for a given term. We evaluate these approaches on the GeneOntology.

The verified implementation stores terms as directed acyclic graphs by means of a pointer structure. Its time complexity is $O(n^2)$ and its space complexity $O(n)$ , and it can be executed in ACL2 at a speed comparable to a similar C implementation. We report the main issues encountered to achieve this formally verified implementation.

#!Diffusion processes, and their discrete time counterparts, random walk models, have demonstrated an ability to account for a wide range of findings from behavioural decision making for which the purely algebraic and deterministic models often used in economics and psychology cannot account. Recent studies that record neural activations in non-human primates during perceptual decision making tasks have revealed that neural firing rates closely mimic the accumulation of preference theorized by behaviourally-derived diffusion models of decision making.This article bridges the expanse between the neurophysiological and behavioural decision making literatures specifically, decision field theory [Busemeyer, J. R. & Townsend, J. T. (1993). Decision field theory: A dynamic-cognitive approach to decision making in an uncertain environment. Psychological Review, 100, 432-459], a dynamic and stochastic random walk theory of decision making, is presented as a model positioned between lower-level neural activation patterns and more complex notions of decision making found in psychology and economics. Potential neural correlates of this model are proposed, and relevant competing models are also addressed.

#!Performance is an important attribute of a software system. To develop a software system of acceptable performance, the team needs to specify precise performance requirements, design appropriate test cases, and use suitable techniques to analyze the performance characteristics. However, the lack of a structured framework for performance engineering may impair the effectiveness of the techniques. We propose the Performance Refinement and Evolution Model (PREM) as a performance management framework. Based on the specification of quantitative measurement and workloads, PREM classifies performance requirements specification, analysis activities, and testing into four levels. In this paper, we provide an overview of this model.

#!In the dynamic environment of semiconductor manufacturing operations, a bottleneck could be created at the bake furnaces of the deposition loop as capacity expands. Upgrading of the bake furnaces by adding a lot-per-batch in the boat or purchasing a new furnace are two possible solutions to this problem. A simulation model was constructed to assist the decision making, with the behavior of the wet benches (upstream tools) and cluster tools (downstream tools) being modeled in detail. We concluded that a limited number of furnaces upgrade is sufficient to sustain the capacity expansion. But the bottleneck was shifted to an upstream tool, which required the backup tool to be activated to manage the queue. A loading policy that constrains batches to queue at maximum time before loading into the furnaces has to be implemented to balance the efficiency at the furnaces and their downstream tools, without compromising on the cycle time.

#!Determining optimal subspace projections that can maintain task-relevant information in the data is an important problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric nonlinear subspace projection technique that maintains class separability maximally under the Shannon mutual information (MI) criterion. Employing kernel density estimates for nonparametric estimation of MI makes possible an interesting marriage of kernel density estimation-based information theoretic methods and kernel machines, which have the ability to determine nonparametric nonlinear solutions for difficult problems in machine learning. Significant computational savings are achieved by translating the definition of the desired projection into the kernel-induced feature space, which leads to obtain analytical solution.

#!This paper describes an approach based on evolutionary algorithms, HIDER (HIerarchical DEcision Rules), for learning rules in continuous and discrete domains. The algorithm produces a hierarchical set of rules, that is, the rules are sequentially obtained and must be therefore tried in order until one is found whose conditions are satisfied. Due to the computational cost of the evolutionary algorithms, we have developed a preprocesing method to reduce the number of examples from the database. This method, named EOP (Editing by Ordered Projections), has some interesting characteristics, especially from the point of view of the application of axis&dash;parallel classifiers. We have tested our system on real data from the UCI Repository, and the results of a 10&dash;fold cross&dash;validation are compared to C4.5's and C4.5Rules'. The experiments showed that HIDER works well in practice.

#!This paper proposes a novel edge detection method for both gray level images and color images. The 3x3 mask in the image is considered and two pixel sets S"0 and S"1 in the mask are used to define an objective function. The values of the objective function corresponding to four directions determine the edge intensity and edge direction of each pixel in the mask. After all pixels in the image have been processed, the edge map and direction map are generated. Then we apply the non-maxima suppression method to the edge map and the direction map to extract the edge points. The proposed method can detect the edge successfully, while double edges, thick edges, and speckles can be avoided.

#!The objective of this paper is to present the development of a simulation model involving materials handling in a large steel company from Arcelor Group. The project had a return of more than 2 million USD and points to a kind of application that seems to be a typical case where static analysis may cause great errors comparing to a dynamic one (because the results were also observed in another Brazilian steel company). The project focused in the processes involving pig iron transportation between the blast furnaces and its discharge in the steelmaking plant. It allowed the evaluation of several operational parameters such as for the 7.5 Mt/year production rhythm, a great increase from the actual production of 5 Mt/year. "Bottlenecks" in the flow were identified through the results and the scenarios gave the support to the decision of increasing the number of torpedo-cars and locomotives in the system.

#index1355
#!Pervasive computing environments introduce new requirements in expressiveness and flexibility of access control policies which are almost addressable leveraging contextual information. Although context-awareness augments the expressiveness of policies, it increases the probability of arising conflicts. Generally, context-aware authorizations are defined using some contextual constraints on the involved entities in an access request. Accordingly, principles like "more specific overrides", which are employed to resolve possible conflicts, are required to consider the contextual constraints. In this paper, we formalize the use of context constraints in a typical context-aware multi-authority policy model; each authority is capable of defining an expressive conflict resolution policy leveraging context-based precedence establishment principles. Based on the policy model, we propose a comprehensive graph-based approach to resolve conflicts. The strength of the approach is that conflict detection which requires context-based inference is almost done statically and resolution is left for run-time.

#!Providing data availability in a high performance computing environment is very important, especially in this data-intensive world. Most clusters either equip with RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) devices or use redundant nodes to protect data from loss. However, neither of these can really solve the reliability problem incurred in a striped file system. Striping provides an efficient way to increase I/O throughput both in the distributed and parallel paradigms. But it also reduces the overall reliability of a disk system by N fold, where N is the number of independent disks in the system. Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS) is an open source parallel file system which has been widely used in the Linux environment. Its striping structure is good for performance but provides no fault tolerance. We implement Reliable Parallel File System (RPFS) based on PVFS but with reliability support. Our quantitative analysis shows that MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) of our RPFS is better than that of PVFS. Besides, we propose a parity cache table (PCT) to alleviate the penalty of parity updating. The evaluation of our RPFS shows that its read performance is almost the same as that of PVFS (2% to 13% degradation). As to the write performance, 28% to 45% improvement can be achieved depending on the behavior of the operations.

#!Summary: Sungear is a software system that supports a rapid, visually interactive and biologist-driven comparison of large datasets. The datasets can come from microarray experiments (e.g. genes induced in each experiment), from comparative genomics (e.g. genes present in each genome) or even from non-biological applications (e.g. demographics or baseball statistics). Sungear represents multiple datasets as vertices in a polygon. Each possible intersection among the sets is represented as a circle inside the polygon. The position of the circle is determined by the position of the vertices represented in the intersection and the area of the circle is determined by the number of elements in the intersection. Sungear shows which Gene Ontology terms are over-represented in a subset of circles or anchors. The intuitive Sungear interface has enabled biologists to determine quickly which dataset or groups of datasets play a role in a biological function of interest. Availability: A live online version of Sungear can be found at http://virtualplant-prod.bio.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/sungear/index.cgi Contact: shasha@cs.nyu.edu Supplementary information: Submitted---link TBD.

#!Recently, cars are equipped with a lot of sensors for safety driving. We have been trying to store the driving-scene video with such sensor data and to detect the change of scenery of streets. Detection results can be used for building historical database of town scenery, automatic landmark updating of maps, and so forth. In order to compare images to detect changes, image retrieval taken at nearly identical locations is required as the first step. Since Global Positioning System (GPS) data essentially contain some noises, we cannot rely only on GPS data for our image retrieval. Therefore, we have developed an image retrieval algorithm employing edge-histogram-based image features in conjunction with hierarchical search. By using edge histograms projected onto the vertical and horizontal axes, the retrieval has been made robust to image variation due to weather change, clouds, obstacles, and so on. In addition, matching cost has been made small by limiting the matching candidates employing the hierarchical search. Experimental results have demonstrated that the mean retrieval accuracy has been improved from 65% to 76% for the front-view images and from 34% to 53% for the side-view images.

#*Dynamic fractal unifying interaction confirmed with magnetospheric behavior and orbital data: Research Articles
#@Eugene Savov

#cComplexity
#index1395
#!The solar wind makes the magnetosphere to expand and contract as indicated by the expansions and contractions of the auroral oval due to balancing of the dynamic pressure of the ambient space plasma at inner and outer magnetic lines. This self-similar magnetospheric behavior elucidates the controversial magnetic storm-substorm relationship and reveals the 3D-spiral structure of magnetic interaction. The found self-similarly evolving structure of one seen as fundamental interaction suggests dynamic fractal unifying interaction that builds a firework universe having 3D-spiral code. The unifying interaction is described with equation drawn in new fundamental dynamic fractal framework. The equation of unifying interaction converges to the inverse square laws and the principle of uncertainty at laboratory scales. The dynamic fractal fundamental framework is made of one 3D-spirally-faster-inward contracting and expanding, oscillating, basic matter. It simply accounts for observed constant speed of light and for the creation of bright and dark bands on a screen behind a tiny slit. The dynamic fractal framework is quantitatively confirmed with the orbital data for the Milky Way Galaxy, the Sun, the Earth, and the triple asteroid system 87 Sylvia. Many testable predictions are also made. The presented new fundamental dynamic fractal framework allows qualitative and quantitative modeling and simplification. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!A class of implicit two-step integration methods is introduced having s stages which may be computed in parallel. Since all stage solutions are approximations with equal accuracy and stability properties these methods were attributed as 'peer' methods. Using a special result on Vandermonde matrices we identify one subclass of order s-1 which is zero stable for general stepsize sequences. A further analysis for singularly perturbed problems shows that no order reduction occurs and the accuracy is essentially determined by the regularity of the smooth component. These results are backed by several numerical examples even including one differential algebraic problem.

#!For a simplicial complex X and a field K, let h˜i(X) = dim H˜i (X; K).It is shown that if X, Y are complexes on the same vertex set, then for k ≥ 0 h˜k-1(X ∩ Y) ≤ Σσ ∈ Y Σi+j=k h˜i-1 (X[σ])ċ h˜j-1 (lk(Y, σ)).A simplicial complex X is d-Leray over K, if H˜i(Y; K) = 0 for all induced subcomplexes Y ⊂ X and i ≥ d. Let LK(X) denote the minimal d such that X is d-Leray over K. The above theorem implies that if X, Y are simplicial complexes on the same vertex set then LK(X ∩ Y) ≤ LK(X) + LK(Y).Reformulating this inequality in commutative algebra terms, we obtain the following result conjectured by Terai: If I, J are square-free monomial ideals in S = K[x1, ..., xn], then reg(I + J) ≤ reg(I) + reg(J) - 1, where reg (I) denotes the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of I.

#!The complexity of animating trees, shrubs and foliage is an impediment to the efficient and realistic depiction of natural environments. This paper presents an algorithm to extract, from a single video sequence, motion fields of real shrubs under the influence of wind, and to transfer this motion to the animation of complex, synthetic 3D plant models. The extracted motion is retargeted without requiring physical simulation. First, feature tracking is applied to the video footage, allowing the 2D position and velocity of automatically identified features to be clustered. A key contribution of the method is that the hierarchy obtained through statistical clustering can be used to synthesize a 2D hierarchical geometric structure of branches that terminates according to the cut-off threshold of a classification algorithm. This step extracts both the shape and the motion of a hierarchy of features groups that are identified as geometrical branches. The 2D hierarchy is then extended to three dimensions using the estimated spatial distribution of the features within each group. Another key contribution is that this 3D hierarchical structure can be efficiently used as a motion controller to animate any complex 3D model of similar but non-identical plants using a standard skinning algorithm. Thus, a single video source of a moving shrub becomes an input device for a large class of virtual shrubs. We illustrate the results on two examples of shrubs and one outdoor tree. Extensions to other outdoor plants are discussed.

#!Within the European &lsquo;Vehicle Model Based Diagnosis&rsquo; (VMBD) project, demonstrator vehicles with built&dash;in faults provided a serious challenge to model&dash;based diagnosis techniques and a real&dash;life test&dash;bed for their evaluation. One of the guiding applications within VMBD was model&dash;based on&dash;board diagnosis of faults in a turbo diesel engine system with a focus on potential origins of increased carbon emissions. This paper focuses on the application aspects. We discuss the requirements imposed, the way they were addressed by the chosen solutions, and the results obtained by the on&dash;board diagnosis prototype running on the demonstrator vehicle. The most important challenges of the demonstrator were to apply model&dash;based diagnosis systems to dynamic systems with feedback, to handle systems without a rigorous mathematical model (such as a combustion engine), and to try to provide the response times required for real&dash;time applications.

#!We propose a robust algorithm for estimating the projective reconstruction from image features using the RANSAC-based Triangulation method. In this method, we select input points randomly, separate the input points into inliers and outliers by computing their reprojection error, and correct the outliers so that they can become inliers. The reprojection error and correcting outliers are computed using the Triangulation method. After correcting the outliers, we can reliably recover projective motion and structure using the projective factorization method. Experimental results showed that errors can be reduced significantly compared to the previous research as a result of robustly estimated projective reconstruction.

#!Ontological analysis has been shown to be an effective first step in the construction of robust knowledge based systems. However, the modeling and simulation community has not taken advantage of the benefits of ontology management methods and tools. Moreover, the popularity of semantic technologies and the semantic web has provided several beneficial opportunities for the modeling and simulation communities of interest. This paper describes the role of ontologies in facilitating simulation modeling. It outlines the technical challenges in distributed simulation modeling and describes how ontology-based methods may be applied to address these challenges. The paper concludes by describing an ontology-based solution framework for simulation modeling and analysis and outlining the benefits of this solution approach.

#!If you are a network administrator, you're under a lot of pressure to ensure that mission-critical systems are completely safe from malicious code, buffer overflows, stealth port scans, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, CGI attacks, and other network intruders. Designing a reliable way to detect intruders before they get in is an essential--but often overwhelming--challenge. Snort, the defacto open source standard of intrusion detection tools, is capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP network.

#!Every company large and small wants to boost its sales, control its spending, and keep the auditors at the Internal Revenue Service happy. But, no company wants to waste time on more paperwork. These days, a growing number of companies are turning to QuickBooks accounting software not only to speed up their bookkeeping efforts, but manage their businesses more effectively. Organizations come in all shapes, sizes, and business models, so it's no surprise that accounting practices can be a convoluted road to travel. QuickBooks can handle many of the financial tasks companies face, but the price you pay is an overabundance of software features. To make the learning curve even more challenging, QuickBooks doesn't come with a manual. Fortunately, to help pave the road to accounting success, there's QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual, a comprehensive guide from O'Reilly that examines everything the QuickBooks Pro edition has to offer, from invoices and inventory to assets and accounts payable. With QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual, financial managers can quickly learn how to use the program's tools to implement and maintain critical accounting processes. By covering details in a friendly and light-hearted way, the book explains when and why a feature is useful, and then offers indispensable, relevant advice. Each page of this Missing Manual provides insightful tips and tricks to help readers become more efficient, sophisticated users no matter what the extent of their existing knowledge is. Whether you're interested in QuickBooks for its basic bookkeeping features or its more powerful, business planning tools, the only way to truly harness its power is to read the book that should have been in the box: QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual.

#!Praise for the First Edition “Trust me on this one...if you're an Active Directory engineer or architect, this is the book you need. It's the companion that's going to help you keep your job if you're up in the middle of the night trying to understand how something works or why it's not working. It's truly an amazing book.” -Scott Rachui, MCSE and Senior Active Directory Engineer, author of MCSE Exchange Server 5.5 for Dummies “This is the best book on Windows 2000 that I have read and one of the best computer books I have ever read. The most unique quality is the excellent explanation of how to use scripting to maximize your results and minimize your effort. This book is especially well suited to the enterprise audience that has to deploy many servers (100+) and not just 1-10. If you have even a small bit of programming experience, you will really appreciate the in-depth explanations of Windows 2000 under the covers.” -Eric Chipko “Wow!! I love this book. I'd trade all my books covering Active Directory for this book in a second. The material is covered at a depth that I haven't seen in any other book-and I've looked at most of them. The material is presented in a straightforward manner that doesn't put you to sleep. An NT4 administrator could easily read this book and become an expert at Active Directory. I especially appreciated the chapter on Active Directory security.” -Brian Arkills, author of LDAP Directories ExplainedPraise for the Second Edition “If you are committed and really desire to know what makes Active Directory tick-and with it the backbone of the latest, and greatest, generation of Windows Network Operating Systems-then there is no better guide to get you there than this book. Inside Active Directory has no equal in the breadth, depth, and scope of its value to a technical practitioner.” -Rick Kingslan, Microsoft MVP, Directory Services “Kouti and Seitsonen provide excellent coverage of topics a lot of people have difficulty understanding and setting up properly. This book supplies you with sound background theory so you can understand these concepts and at the same time gives just the right amount of detail to actually accomplish what you are trying to do.” -Harold McFarland, Editor, Readers Preference Reviews “The style of this book is very appealing. It gives sufficient detail for the experienced administrator and explains what is happening 'behind the scenes' at each step, which is extremely helpful when problems arise. An excellent read and an essential component for any skilled administrator!” -Jeff Dunkelberger, Solutions Architect “An outstanding refresh of an already great book, Inside Active Directory, Second Edition, should be in the toolbox of any serious Active Directory administrator, architect, or developer. Inside Active Directory is one of the five books I refer to on a weekly basis. Thanks to the authors for all their hard work and dedication.” -Joe Richards, Microsoft MVP, Windows Server/Active DirectoryThe most practical, comprehensive, and highly praised guide to Active Directory has now been fully updated for Windows Server 2003.

#@Kyparisia A. Papanikolaou,Andrew Mabbott,Susan Bull,Maria Grigoriadou
#t2006
#cInteracting with Computers
#index1538
#!Recently, research in individual differences and in particular, learning and cognitive style, has been used as a basis to consider learner preferences in a web-based educational context. Modelling style in a web-based learning environment demands that developers build a specific framework describing how to design a variety of options for learners with different approaches to learning. In this paper two representative examples of educational systems, Flexi-OLM and INSPIRE, that provide learners a variety of options designed according to specific style categorisations, are presented. Experimental results from two empirical studies performed on the systems to investigate learners' learning and cognitive style, and preferences during interaction, are described. It was found that learners do have a preference regarding their interaction, but no obvious link between style and approaches offered, was detected. Derived from an examination of this experimental data, we suggest that while style information can be used to inform the design of learning environments that accommodate learners' individual differences, it would be wise to recommend interactions based on learners' behaviour. Learning environments should allow learners or learners' interaction behaviour to select or trigger the appropriate approach for the particular learner in the specific context. Alternative approaches towards these directions are also discussed.

#cProceedings of the 21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops - Volume 01
#index1554
#!Although many defense techniques against scanning worms have been developed, they have difficulty in ingress filtering if the incoming scanning traffic has insufficient intensity, which is usually the case. To make matters worse, legitimate Internet services behaving like worms and dynamic network environments undermines the efficacy of the techniques. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient defense algorithm against Internet scanning worms that has high detection rate and low false positive rate. Our defense algorithm observes the protocol behavior of TCP SYN retries and applies a relative entropy scheme, which is used for measuring the distance between two distributions, to process the collected information. It builds up the black-list to isolate detected hosts from the Internet, and adjusts related parameters adaptively according to the observed traffic. Moreover, it acquires the simplicity and effectiveness at the ingress point only by inspecting SYN retry on a unidirectional link, which makes the defense mechanism easily applicable to a network. Against real-life traces, we investigate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with that of SNORT. The results manifest clearly that our algorithm outperforms the rate-based detection technique in terms of detection rate, detection speed and false positive rate.

#!Packet loss models play an essential role in computer networks analysis. Performance evaluation studies often abstract the loss and delay characteristics of a path or network with a single end-to-end analytical model. This model should be able to represent the characteristics of the path and accurately reproduce the impact of delay and losses on the studied protocol while keeping complexity low.

#!This paper presents a Business-Oriented Model of Factors that affect the adoption of wireless High Speed Data Services (HSDS). We reviewed business IT acceptance literature and developed an explorative survey of a sample of twelve companies in Europe and USA. From this, a theoretical model was created and hypotheses were formulated. Data were then collected on a sample of 1545 companies in USA and Europe. Based on these results, we developed a model that combined the key ideas of both TAM and TTF and showed that both were necessary in predicting wireless High Speed Data Service adoption.

#!“This book clearly shows how today's industry pressures and business challenges mandate renewal of the contract between organizations and their IT assets and peopleï¾and it illustrates how a service-oriented approach to IT can help organizations go through the necessary transformation. The role of governance in bringing IT and business closer together is particularly well explained, and the book is worth reading for that alone.” ï¾Neil Ward-Dutton, Research Director, Macehiter Ward-Dutton “It's easy to pay lip service to the concept of business/IT alignment, but in The New Language of Business, Sandy Carter walks the walk. Few treatments of SOA ground this admittedly difficult topic in the world of business as thoroughly as Sandy has here. I'd recommend this book to any business reader who wants to leverage IT to make their business more agile and innovative, and to any technical reader who wishes to understand how to place SOA in the business context where it belongs.” ï¾Jason Bloomberg, Senior Analyst and Principal, ZapThink LLC “A very valuable read. In today's globally connected marketplace profitable growth requires business flexibility and continuous innovation, both of which are increasingly proving to be impossible without business modularity and the new table-stakes technology SOA.” ï¾Ron Williams, Professor, Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill “Sandy has provided a pragmatic and holistic perspective on Service Oriented Architectures. She adds credibility by sharing IBM's in-depth customer research as well as case studies to support the findings. The book is a strong source book for those wanting to get started with SOA.” ï¾Judith Hurwitz, President & CEO, Hurwitz & Associates, coauthor, Service Oriented Architectures for Dummies “Few people have thought as long or as hard about SOA as Sandy Carter. This book embodies her invaluable work and the work of many at IBM to research, define, deploy and make SOA happen. Useful not just from a SOA perspective, but also as a concise articulation of the contemporary concepts fundamental to understanding where business and IT are heading.” ï¾Carol Baroudi, coauthor Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies, Senior Analyst, Aberdeen Group “The New Language of Business: SOA & Web 2.0 is based on the collective feedback from industry leaders at organizations of all sizes, in more than 50 countries, who shared their views, experiences, and challenges of aligning technology with business goals.” ï¾From the foreword by Steve Mills, Senior Vice President and Group Executive,ï¾ IBM Software Group There is now a direct, provable link between an organization's flexibility and business performance. To optimize flexibility, companies must achieve unprecedented levels of integration and automation of key processes and infrastructure, both internally and externally. At the same time, they must learn to manage their processes far more dynamically and responsively. They must become flex-pon-sive*. Until recently, technology stood in the way of achieving these goals. Thanks to the emergence of service oriented architecture (SOA), Web 2.0, and open standards, technology now enables companies to achieve those goals. In The New Language of Business, one of IBM's top SOA strategist demonstrates how business leaders can use innovations in technology to drive dramatic process improvements and support accelerating change. Sandy Carter shows how to deconstruct your business into a “componentized” business model, then support that model with linked, repeatable IT services that can adapt quickly, easily, and economically. These techniques will help both IT professionals and business leaders reach new levels of operational excellence to deliver the market-focused innovations that matter most.

Writing for executives and business leaders inside and outside IT, Carter explains why flexibility and responsiveness are now even more crucial to successï¾and why services-based strategies offer the greatest promise for achieving them. You'll learn how to organize your business into reusable process componentsï¾and support them with cost-effective IT services that adapt quickly and easily to change.

#!Runtime Patterns with Caching Proxy and Tivoli Access Manager User authentication and authorization Runtime node placement guidelines Security is such a fundamental enabler of e-busines that in the emerging business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) markets, effective security can make the difference betwen being successful and becoming an “also ran”. The promise of e-business and its ability to create new revenue streams is predicated on the ability of these new business processes to reach these new markets and customers. That promise can evaporate if security issues are not addressed up front. This IBM Redbook addresses the security issues of user authentication and authorization using the concept of Patterns. Patterns for e-business are a group of proven, reusable assets that can help speed the process of developing applications. In this redbook, we describe guidelines and options for the selection of Runtime patterns that include user authentication and authorization considerations in the design process. Specifically, we address software and node configuration scenarios within the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and give examples of implementation procedures.

#!Message-based communication offers the potential benefits of providing stronger specification and cleaner separation between components. Compared with shared-memory interactions, message passing has the potential disadvantages of more expensive data exchange (no direct sharing) and more complicated programming.In this paper we report on the language, verification, and run-time system features that make messages practical as the sole means of communication between processes in the Singularity operating system. We show that using advanced programming language and verification techniques, it is possible to provide and enforce strong system-wide invariants that enable efficient communication and low-overhead software-based process isolation. Furthermore, specifications on communication channels help in detecting programmer mistakes early---namely at compile-time---thereby reducing the difficulty of the message-based programming model.The paper describes our communication invariants, the language and verification features that support them, as well as implementation details of the infrastructure. A number of benchmarks show the competitiveness of this approach.

#!Desktop operating systems such as Windows and Linux base scheduling decisions on CPU consumption; processes that consume fewer CPU cycles are prioritized, assuming that interactive processes gain from this since they spend most of their time waiting for user input. However, this doesn't work for modern multimedia applications which require significant CPU resources. We therefore suggest a new metric to identify interactive processes by explicitly measuring interactions with the user, and we use it to design and implement a process scheduler. Measurements using a variety of applications indicate that this scheduler is very effective in distinguishing between competing interactive and noninteractive processes.

#!We consider involutory antimorphisms ϕ of a free monoid A* and their fixed points, called ϕ-palindromes or pseudopalindromes. A ϕ-palindrome reduces to a usual palindrome when ϕ is the reversal operator. For any word w ∈ A* the right (resp. left) ϕ-palindrome closure of w is the shortest ϕ-palindrome having w as a prefix (resp. suffix). We prove some results relating ϕ-palindrome closure operators with periodicity and conjugacy, and derive some interesting closure properties for the languages of finite Sturmian and episturmian words. In particular, a finite word w is Sturmian if and only if both its palindromic closures are so. Moreover, in such a case, both the palindromic closures of w share the same minimal period of w. A new characterization of finite Sturmian words follows, in terms of periodicity and special factors of their palindromic closures. Some weaker results can be extended to the episturmian case. By using the right ϕ-palindrome closure, we extend the construction of standard episturmian words via directive words. In this way one obtains a family of infinite words, called ϕ-standard words, which are morphic images of episturmian words, as well as a wider family of infinite words including the Thue-Morse word on two symbols.

#*A parametric associative memory emulation
#@S. H. Dalrymple
#t1975
#cACM SIGMICRO Newsletter
#index1606
#!An experimental associative memory facility has been created by microprogramming a conventional computer. The microprogramming was done by expansion of an IBM 1130 emulation that was microcoded on a Digital Scientific Corporation META 4 computer. The associative memory (AM), as seen by the 1130 applications programmer, is an integral part of the computer with 54 machine instructions provided for its control and use.The structural characteristics of the apparent associative memory are parametrically defined to the emulation via a special SETUP command. This command may occur repeatedly within a program to dynamically alter the AM's characteristics or, indeed, to provide several different AM's. The characteristics that may be specified include the cell width (W) in 16-bit word increments, the number of cells (N), the locations in core memory to be used by the AM and its associated registers, and the memory protect status of these memory locations. The parameters are maintained in a fast scratch-pad memory, whence they are employed to control the AM emulation.Three pseudoregisters are used by the associative memory: (1) a data register (DR), which can hold the contents of one cell (i. e., W bits in length); (2) a response register (RR) N bits in length; and (3) an availability register (AR), also N bits in length.The data register provides the primary interface between the AM and the 1130 program. The response register is employed to indicate which cells in the AM have responded to a given search command. The availability register is used to indicate which cells are empty (or available) and which are to be considered whenever a search command is executed. The AM can be addressed either conventionally or associatively.The commands provided to utilize the AM fall into five categories: (1) register commands to manipulate the DR, RR, and AR; (2) fetch and store commands to store and retrieve information; (3) search commands to compare a given argument against the AM; (4) field-to-field search commands that compare two fields within each cell; and (5) test and branch instructions. Field specifications for search commands are defined through the use of pointer and length information contained within the command.Communication with the AM is via the DR. Search arguments and data to be stored are placed there, as are data retrieved from the AM. Searches permitted include match, no match, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, next lower, next greater, minimum, and maximum.The commands themselves, viewed as 1130 operators, may occupy either one, two, or three machine words, depending upon the operation, and may contain an address, one or two pointer specifications, one or two length specifications, a reset flag, or an immediate value, as required. Indexing is permitted for those operations having an address. The code-cracking mechanism of the 1130 emulation is used but is augmented to handle the three-word instructions. Microsubprograms are then executed for each emulated instruction or class of instructions.The META 4 computer on which the AM system was implemented is a flexible, logical processor that is controlled by an easily modified, random-access, read-only memory (ROM). Up to 32 general-purpose registers may be employed, together with three data buses (two source and one destination), an arithmetic-logical unit, and a shifter unit. Control is exercised at the gate level via microcode commands, 32 bits in length, in the ROM. Core memory is treated essentially as a peripheral with access via a pair of registers, one for data and the other for address information. The usual complement of peripherals, card readers, printers, disks, etc., may be attached.The basic hardware configuration required for 1130 emulation on a META 4 consists of 8K main-core memory, 2K read-only memory, and 20 registers. This configuration was augmented for the AM emulation by the addition of 8K more core, 2K additional ROM, two additional registers, two scratch-pad memories of 64 words each, and a set of internal timers to provide timing information on application programs.Several applications have been programmed in both a conventional manner and by using the associative memory capability in order to obtain relative timing information. One such application, a personnel file information storage and retrieval system, has provided a speed advantage of as much as 10 to 1 when the AM is employed. Building on the AM capability, a set of macroinstructions was developed to provide an apparent associative processor. Several matrix manipulation routines were developed using this facility, and these routines also exhibited a significant speed advantage over their conventionally programmed counterparts.

#!Setting up your DDF environment Analyzing DDF performance Advanced topics: Thread pooling, sysplex support, and HiperSockets When DB2's Distributed Data Facility (DDF) was announced in the late eighties, it was looked at by many people as a nice gadget, but not something anybody would use in a real OLTP production environment. Distributed database access and DB2's DDF have come a long way since. DDF is now a full-function transaction monitor, using a highly efficient database interoperability protocol (DRDA) equipped with thread pooling and connection management that allows it to support very large networks. In this IBM Redbook we describe how to set up your DDF environment, and how to deploy the DDF capabilities in different configurations, including how to develop applications that access distributed databases. We also describe a set of more advanced features, such as thread pooling, and high availability distributed configurations, in a DB2 data sharing environment. We also demonstrate the advantages of using HiperSockets with DB2 for z/OS and OS/390 and DB2 Connect for zLinux. As performance and problem analysis are very important in today's production environments with applications demanding subsecond response times and zero down time, the publication also discusses the traces available to you to do performance monitoring and problem determination. We hope that after reading this publication you will have a better view of a wide range of functions that DDF has to offer, and say "Wow, I had no idea that I could do all of this with DDF!"

#!Several strategies to retrieve depth information from a sequence of images have been described so far. In this paper a method that turns around the existing symbiosis between stereovision and motion is introduced; motion minimizes correspondence ambiguities, and stereovision enhances motion information. The central idea behind our approach is to transpose the spatially defined problem of disparity estimation into the spatial-temporal domain. Motion is analyzed in the original sequences by means of the so-called permanency effect and the disparities are calculated from the resulting two-dimensional motion charge maps. This is an important contribution to the traditional stereovision depth analysis, where disparity is got from the image luminescence. In our approach, disparity is studied from a motion-based persistency charge measure.

#!This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm (a-hGA) with adaptive local search scheme. For designing the a-hGA, a local search technique is incorporated in the loop of genetic algorithm (GA), and whether or not the local search technique is used in the GA is automatically determined by the adaptive local search scheme. Two modes of adaptive local search schemes are developed in this paper. First mode is to use the conditional local search method that can measure the average fitness values obtained from the continuous two generations of the a-hGA, while second one is to apply the similarity coefficient method that can measure a similarity among the individuals of the population of the a-hGA. These two adaptive local search schemes are included in the a-hGA loop, respectively. Therefore, the a-hGA can be divided into two types: a- hGA1 and a-hGA2. To prove the efficiency of the a-hGA1 and a-hGA2, a canonical GA (cGA) and a hybrid GA (hGA) with local search technique and without any adaptive local search scheme are also presented. In numerical example, all the algorithms (cGA, hGA, a-hGA1 and a-hGA2) are tested and analyzed. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed a-hGA1 and a-hGA2 is proved by various measures of performance.

#!Two identical customers with deterministically identical service times arrive at a queueing system simultaneously (Twins), but leave the system 2 hours apart. Is their sojourn time predictable? Is the system fair? We propose a novel measure based on the principle that in a predictable and fair system, "twin" customers should not depart the system very far apart. We analyze this measure for a number of common service policies and compare the results. We compare the results to those of other fairness and predictability approaches proposed recently and discuss its usefulness.

#!This paper presents a novel VR (Virtual Reality) trained BDI (belief, desire, intention) software agent used to construct crowd simulations for emergency response. The BDI framework allows modeling of human behavior with a high degree of fidelity. The proposed simulation has been developed using AnyLogic software to mimic crowd evacuation from an area under a terrorist bomb attack. The attributes that govern the BDI characteristics of the agent are studied by conducting human in the loop experiments in VR using the CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment). To enhance generality and interoperability of the proposed crowd simulation modeling scheme, input data models have been developed to define environment attributes. Experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the effect of various parameters on key performance indicators such as crowd evacuation rate and densities.

#!The effects of metaphors on learning have been proved by many studies. Learners naturally invoke metaphors when learning new concepts because metaphors stimulate them to generate models of the domain to be learned. However, little evidence has been seen of metaphors' effect on developing learners' mental models. Since metaphors function by providing familiar concepts that help learners to construct new knowledge, metaphors' effects may be more apparent to novice learners. This study explores the effects of metaphors on both novice and expert learners' performance and their mental-model development as documented by three different measurement methods. It also examines the relationship between subjects' performance and their mental models. The results indicate that metaphors may facilitate novices' construction of integrative knowledge but not simple knowledge. In addition, metaphors may possibly have lasting effects on expert learning but the effects may not be seen immediately after learning.

#!We present a method for progressive deforming meshes. Most existing mesh decimation methods focus on static meshes. However, there are more and more animation data today, and it is important to address the problem of simplifying deforming meshes. Our method is based on deformation oriented decimation (DOD) error metric and dynamic connectivity updating (DCU) algorithm. Deformation oriented decimation extends the deformation sensitivity decimation (DSD) error metric by augmenting an additional term to model the distortion introduced by deformation. This new metric preserves not only geometric features but also areas with large deformation. Using this metric, a static reference connectivity is extracted for the whole animation. Dynamic connectivity updating algorithm utilizes vertex trees to further reduce geometric distortion by allowing the connectivity to change. Temporal coherence in the dynamic connectivity between frames is achieved by penalizing large deviations from the reference connectivity. The combination of DOD and DCU demonstrates better simplification and triangulation performance than previous methods for deforming mesh simplification.

#index1645
#!Motivation: We introduce a novel approach to multiple alignment that is based on an algorithm for rapidly checking whether single matches are consistent with a partial multiple alignment. This leads to a sequence annealing algorithm, which is an incremental method for building multiple sequence alignments one match at a time. Our approach improves significantly on the standard progressive alignment approach to multiple alignment. Results: The sequence annealing algorithm performs well on benchmark test sets of protein sequences. It is not only sensitive, but also specific, drastically reducing the number of incorrectly aligned residues in comparison to other programs. The method allows for adjustment of the sensitivity/specificity tradeoff and can be used to reliably identify homologous regions among protein sequences. Availability: An implementation of the sequence annealing algorithm is available at http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/amap/ Contact: sariel@cs.berkeley.edu

#!Scheduling a program (i.e. constructing a timetable for the execution of its operations) is one of the most powerful methods for automatic parallelization. A schedule gives a blueprint for constructing a synchronous program, suitable for an ASIC or VLIW processor. However, constructing a schedule entails solving a large linear program. Even if one accepts the (experimental) fact that the Simplex is almost always polynomial, the scheduling time is of the order of a large power of the program size. Hence, the method does not scale well. The present paper proposes two methods for improving the situation. First, a large program can be divided into smaller units (processes), which can be scheduled separately. This is structured scheduling. Second, one can use projection methods for solving linear programs incrementally. This is specially efficient if the dependence graph is sparse.

#!e is a programming language designed for modeling and verification of electronic systems. As such it is used extensively in the microchip industry, and was recently declared an IEEE standard, e is also a powerful general-purpose language used in the implementation of complex commercial software tools.It was suggested some time ago that a number of idioms in e resemble those of AOP, but the suggestion was never examined in depth. The present paper takes up this task. For this purpose the relevant mechanisms in e are compared with those of today's prominent aspect-oriented language - AspectJ - with respect to syntax, semantics, and application.e's aspect-oriented capabilities turn out to be a small subset of AspectJ's, but an interesting one. It is weaker in its support for implementing developmental and non-functional concerns. However, with its simpler syntax and economical semantics, e captures in a natural way crosscutting concerns that stem from the application domain. Thus, e seems to exemplify an original variant of AOP - one that is conservative and robust from a software design point of view.

#!E-Commerce technologies are interactive in nature, yet most research on E-Commerce adoption and use fails to consider this feature and the technology's social context of use in its theorizing. In this paper, we seek to theorize the technological feature of interactivity in a social context of information asymmetry by studying the use of E-Commerce technology among car sales associates in the US. Drawing on Social Exchange Theory (Kelley, 1979), we develop a model of interactive technology use that incorporates the user's beliefs about his/her exchange partner, the user's attitude toward technology use and the technology's perceived usefulness for the work process it is impacting. After refining our model with insights gained from observations of and interviews with a few car sales associates, we then test our contextualized model of E-Commerce use with data collected from a national survey of car sales associates (n=137).Our results show that attitude and users' beliefs about their exchange partners improve our ability to predict IT use. Furthermore, the contexualization of TAM highlights the theory's assumptions about the unemotional and individually-focused nature of users' decision making with respect to IT use.

#!Graph bandwidth minimization (GBM) is a classical and challenging problem in graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization. Most of existing researches on this problem have focused on unweighted graphs. In this paper, we study the bandwidth minimization problem of weighted caterpillars, and propose several algorithms for solving various types of caterpillars and general graphs. More specifically, we show that the GBM problem on caterpillars with hair-length at most 2 and the GBM problem on star-shape caterpillars are NP-complete, and give a lower bound of the graph bandwidth for general weighted graphs. For caterpillars with hair-length at most 1, we present an O(n log n log(nwmax))-time algorithm to compute an optimal bandwidth layout, where n is the total number of vertices in the graph and wmax is the maximum wedge weight. For caterpillars with hair-length at most k, we give a k-approximation algorithm. For arbitrary caterpillars and general graphs, we give a heuristic algorithm and some experimental results. Experiments show that the solutions obtained by our heuristic algorithm are roughly within a factor of clog(n) of the lower bound for a small number c, which is consistent with the inapproximability results of this problem (i.e., no constant approximation for the GBM problem unless P = NP).

#!A framework is provided for evaluation of packet delay distribution in an optical circuit-switched network. The framework is based on a fluid traffic model, packet queueing at edge routers, and circuit-switched transmission between edge routers. Packets are assigned to buffers according to their destination, delay constraint, physical route and wavelength. At every decision epoch, a subset of buffers is allocated to end-to-end circuits for transmission, where circuit holding times are based on limited and exhaustive circuit allocation policies. To ensure computational tractability, the framework approximates the evolution of each buffer independently. "Slack variables" are introduced to decouple amongst buffers in a way that the evolution of each buffer remains consistent with all other buffers in the network. The delay distribution is derived for a single buffer and an approximation is given for a network of buffers. The approximation entails finding a fixed point for the functional relation between the "slack variables" and a specific circuit allocation policy. An analysis of a specific policy, in which circuits are probabilistically allocated based on buffer size, is given as an illustrative example. The framework is shown to be in good agreement with a discrete event simulation model.

#!One of the typical causes of errors in team cooperative activities, such as in central control rooms of power plants and cockpits in aircrafts, is conflicts among team members' intentions. If mutual awareness and communication were perfectly established and maintained, conflicts could be detected and recovered by team members; however, this does not happen in practice. In this paper, we provide a framework for detecting conflicts among team members' intentions based on team intention inference, aiming to make machines function as a coordinator for cooperative activities. In previous work, we developed a method for team intention inference based on a definition of 'we-intention'. We-intention is other-regarding intentions relating to situations in which some agents act together, and is represented as a set of individual intentions and mutual beliefs. In this framework, a conflict can be defined as a set of individual intentions and false beliefs (undesired procedures), and detected by searching for such combinations. We applied the proposed method to the operation of a plant simulator operated by a two-person team, and it was confirmed through an experiment that this method could list candidates for conflicts by type and set the actual conflict high in priority in the tested context.

#*Evolving dynamic Bayesian networks with Multi-objective genetic algorithms

#!A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is a probabilistic network that models interdependent entities that change over time. Given example sequences of multivariate data, we use a genetic algorithm to synthesize a network structure that models the causal relationships that explain the sequence. We use a multi-objective evaluation strategy with a genetic algorithm. The multi-objective criteria are a network's probabilistic score and structural complexity score. Our use of Pareto ranking is ideal for this application, because it naturally balances the effect of the likelihood and structural simplicity terms used in the BIC network evaluation heuristic. We use a basic structural scoring formula, which tries to keep the number of links in the network approximately equivalent to the number of variables. We also use a simple representation that favors sparsely connected networks similar in structure to those modeling biological phenomenon. Our experiments show promising results when evolving networks ranging from 10 to 30 variables, using a maximal connectivity of between 3 and 4 parents per node. The results from the multi-objective GA were superior to those obtained with a single objective GA.

#!We present a hyper-interaction platform which integrates several newly developed techniques, including motion classification, a motion reaction control mechanism and a high precision 3-D model of the International Space Station. The goal is to build an interaction platform for trainers to navigate in a virtual reality. The platform can be applied to customized mission training. The system integrated visualization environment, underlying 3-D model, and a human body tracking mechanism. The tracking system will be extended to 3-D coordination reconstruction and thus behaviors of users can be precisely identified. These navigation parameters are used in controlling navigation in the 3-D virtual environment. Another important issue of this system is to define a model for motion reaction. The definition of reaction can be applied to avatars or to the virtual environment. These integrated technologies can also be used in other virtual reality environments.

#!We present a method for scattered data approximation with subdivision surfaces which actually uses the true representation of the limit surface as a linear combination of smooth basis functions associated with the control vertices. This is unlike previous techniques which used only piecewise linear approximations of the limit surface. By this we can assign arbitrary parameterizations to the given sample points, including those generated by parameter correction. We present a robust and fast algorithm for exact closest point search on Loop surfaces by combining Newton iteration and non-linear minimization. Based on this we perform unconditionally convergent parameter correction to optimize the approximation with respect to the L2 metric and thus we make a well-established scattered data fitting technique which has been available before only for B-spline surfaces, applicable to subdivision surfaces. Further we exploit the fact that the control mesh of a subdivision surface can have arbitrary connectivity to reduce the L&infin; error up to a certain user-defined tolerance by adaptively restructuring the control mesh. By employing iterative least squares solvers, we achieve acceptable running times even for large amounts of data and we obtain high quality approximations by surfaces with relatively low control mesh complexity compared to the number of sample points. Since we are using plain subdivision surfaces, there is no need for multiresolution detail coefficients and we do not have to deal with the additional overhead in data and computational complexity associated with them.

#!ID-SP-M4M scheme means ID-based series-parallel multisignature schemes for multi-messages. In this paper, we investigate series-parallel multisignature schemes for multi-messages and propose an ID-SP-M4M scheme based on pairings in which signers in the same subgroup sign the same message, and those in different subgroups sign different messages. Our new scheme is an improvement over the series-parallel multisignature schemes introduced by Doi et al. [6]--[8] and subsequent results such as the schemes proposed by Burmester et al. [4] and the original protocols proposed by Tada [20], [21], in which only one message is to be signed. Furthermore, our ID-SP-M4M scheme is secure against forgery signature attack from parallel insiders under the BDH assumption.

#index1743
#!Cramer's rule expresses the solution to a system of simultaneous linear equaations in terms of ratios of determinants. It is widely known as an example of an impractical method for large systems because of the time required to compute the determinants. For 2-by-2 systems this time difficulty disappears and, since the method does not involve a search for pivots, it may appear to have an advantage over Gaussian elimination. In fact, methods based upon 2-by-2 Cramer's rule have been proposed for use on parallel computers. In this note we wish to point out that Cramer's rule is unsatisfactory even for 2-by-2 systems because of roundoff error difficulties.

#*GPS/IMU data fusion using multisensor Kalman filtering: introduction of contextual aspects

#cInformation Fusion
#index1749
#!The aim of this article is to develop a GPS/IMU multisensor fusion algorithm, taking context into consideration. Contextual variables are introduced to define fuzzy validity domains of each sensor. The algorithm increases the reliability of the position information. A simulation of this algorithm is then made by fusing GPS and IMU data coming from real tests on a land vehicle. Bad data delivered by GPS sensor are detected and rejected using contextual information thus increasing reliability. Moreover, because of a lack of credibility of GPS signal in some cases and because of the drift of the INS, GPS/INS association is not satisfactory at the moment. In order to avoid this problem, the authors propose to feed the fusion process based on a multisensor Kalman filter directly with the acceleration provided by the IMU. Moreover, the filter developed here gives the possibility to easily add other sensors in order to achieve performances required.

#!The authors present uncomplicated and well established equations that can be used in simulation or real-world applications to determine key crossing points and aircraft proximity when the trajectory and speed of aircraft pairs are known. These equations, in closed form, were developed for computing the minimum distance between two aircraft within the four-dimensional (4D) space-time domain. The 4D flight proximity information can be used in simulation to evaluate large numbers of scheduled routes over a limited airspace for controller workload assessment. Also, it can be used to detect potential separation violations and impacts of traffic flow management (TFM) strategies. An example of computing the distance between two flights in 4D is presented. Sample aircraft proximity landscape in 4D space-time simulation with MATLAB code is also provided.

#!This paper addresses computational prediction of protein structural classes. Although in recent years progress in this field was made, the main drawback of the published prediction methods is a limited scope of comparison procedures, which in same cases were also improperly performed. Two examples include using protein datasets of varying homology, which has significant impact on the prediction accuracy, and comparing methods in pairs using different datasets. Based on extensive experimental work, the main aim of this paper is to revisit and reevaluate state of the art in this field. To this end, this paper performs a first-of-its-kind comprehensive and multi-goal study, which includes investigation of eight prediction algorithms, three protein sequence representations, three datasets with different homologies and finally three test procedures. Quality of several previously unused prediction algorithms, newly proposed sequence representation, and a new-to-the-field testing procedure is evaluated. Several important conclusions and findings are made. First, the logistic regression classifier, which was not previously used, is shown to perform better than other prediction algorithms, and high quality of previously used support vector machines is confirmed. The results also show that the proposed new sequence representation improves accuracy of the high quality prediction algorithms, while it does not improve results of the lower quality classifiers. The study shows that commonly used jackknife test is computationally expensive, and therefore computationally less demanding 10-fold cross-validation procedure is proposed. The results show that there is no statistically significant difference between these two procedures. The experiments show that sequence homology has very significant impact on the prediction accuracy, i.e. using highly homologous datasets results in higher accuracies. Thus, results of several past studies that use homologous datasets should not be perceived as reliable. The best achieved prediction accuracy for low homology datasets is about 57% and confirms results reported by Wang and Yuan [How good is the prediction of protein structural class by the component-coupled method?. Proteins 2000;38:165-175]. For a highly homologous dataset instance based classification is shown to be better than the previously reported results. It achieved 97% prediction accuracy demonstrating that homology is a major factor that can result in the overestimated prediction accuracy.

#!In secure group communications, the time cost associated with key updates in the events of member join and departure is an important aspect of quality of service, especially in large groups with highly dynamic membership. To achieve better time efficiency, we propose a join-exit-tree (JET) key management framework. First, a special key tree topology with join and exit subtrees is introduced to handle key updates for dynamic membership. Then, optimization techniques are employed to determine the capacities of join and exit subtrees for achieving the best time efficiency, and algorithms are designed to dynamically update the join and exit trees. We show that, on average, the asymptotic time cost for each member join/departure event is reduced to O(log (log n)) from the previous cost of O(log n), where n is the group size. Our experimental results based on simulated user activities as well as the real MBone data demonstrate that the proposed JET scheme can significantly improve the time efficiency, while maintaining low communication and computation cost, of tree-based contributory key management.

#*Perl Best Practices
#@Damian Conway
#t2005
#c
#index1765
#!Many programmers code by instinct, relying on convenient habits or a "style" they picked up early on. They aren't conscious of all the choices they make, like how they format their source, the names they use for variables, or the kinds of loops they use. They're focused entirely on problems they're solving, solutions they're creating, and algorithms they're implementing. So they write code in the way that seems natural, that happens intuitively, and that feels good. But if you're serious about your profession, intuition isn't enough. Perl Best Practices author Damian Conway explains that rules, conventions, standards, and practices not only help programmers communicate and coordinate with one another, they also provide a reliable framework for thinking about problems, and a common language for expressing solutions. This is especially critical in Perl, because the language is designed to offer many ways to accomplish the same task, and consequently it supports many incompatible dialects.With a good dose of Aussie humor, Dr. Conway (familiar to many in the Perl community) offers 256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code--in fact, the best Perl code you possibly can. The guidelines cover code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging.They're designed to work together to produce code that is clear, robust, efficient, maintainable, and concise, but Dr. Conway doesn't pretend that this is the one true universal and unequivocal set of best practices. Instead, Perl Best Practices offers coherent and widely applicable suggestions based on real-world experience of how code is actually written, rather than on someone's ivory-tower theories on how software ought to be created.Most of all, Perl Best Practices offers guidelines that actually work, and that many developers around the world are already using. Much like Perl itself, these guidelines are about helping you to get your job done, without getting in the way.Praise for Perl Best Practices from Perl community members:"As a manager of a large Perl project, I'd ensure that every member of my team has a copy of Perl Best Practices on their desk, and use it as the basis for an in-house style guide." -- Randal Schwartz"There are no more excuses for writing bad Perl programs. All levels of Perl programmer will be more productive after reading this book." -- Peter Scott"Perl Best Practices will be the next big important book in the evolution of Perl. The ideas and practices Damian lays down will help bring Perl out from under the embarrassing heading of "scripting languages". Many of us have known Perl is a real programming language, worthy of all the tasks normally delegated to Java and C++. With Perl Best Practices, Damian shows specifically how and why, so everyone else can see, too." -- Andy Lester"Damian's done what many thought impossible: show how to build large, maintainable Perl applications, while still letting Perl be the powerful, expressive language that programmers have loved for years." -- Bill Odom"Finally, a means to bring lasting order to the process and product of real Perl development teams." -- Andrew Sundstrom "Perl Best Practices provides a valuable education in how to write robust, maintainable Perl, and is a definitive citation source when coaching other programmers." -- Bennett Todd "I've been teaching Perl for years, and find the same question keeps being asked: Where can I find a reference for writing reusable, maintainable Perl code? Finally I have a decent answer." -- Paul Fenwick "At last a well researched, well thought-out, comprehensive guide to Perl style. Instead of each of us developing our own, we can learn good practices from one of Perl's most prolific and experienced authors. I recommend this book to anyone who prefers getting on with the job rather than going back and fixing errors caused by syntax and poor style issues." -- Jacinta Richardson "If you care about programming in any language read this book. Even if you don't intend to follow all of the practices, thinking through your style will improve it." -- Steven Lembark "The Perl community's best author is back with another outstanding book. There has never been a comprehensive reference on high quality Perl coding and style until Perl Best Practices. This book fills a large gap in every Perl bookshelf." -- Uri Guttman

#!Legendre orthogonal moments have been widely used in the field of image analysis. Because their computation by a direct method is very time expensive, recent efforts have been devoted to the reduction of computational complexity. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms are mainly focused on binary images. We propose here a new fast method for computing the Legendre moments, which is not only suitable for binary images but also for grey level images. We first establish a recurrence formula of one-dimensional (1D) Legendre moments by using the recursive property of Legendre polynomials. As a result, the 1D Legendre moments of order p, L"p=L"p(0), can be expressed as a linear combination of L"p"-"1(1) and L"p"-"2(0). Based on this relationship, the 1D Legendre moments L"p(0) can thus be obtained from the arrays of L"1(a) and L"0(a), where a is an integer number less than p. To further decrease the computation complexity, an algorithm, in which no multiplication is required, is used to compute these quantities. The method is then extended to the calculation of the two-dimensional Legendre moments L"p"q. We show that the proposed method is more efficient than the direct method.

#!A data stream is a potentially uninterrupted flow of data. Mining this flow makes it necessary to cope with uncertainty, as only a part of the stream can be stored. In this paper, we evaluate a statistical technique which biases the estimation of the support of patterns, so as to maximize either the precision or the recall, as chosen by the user, and limit the degradation of the other criterion. Theoretical results show that the technique is not far from the optimum, from the statistical standpoint. Experiments performed tend to demonstrate its potential, as it remains robust even under significant distribution drifts.

#*On the expressive power of semi-normal defaults in some semantic variants of default logic

#!Normality, semi-normality and prerequisite-freedom are examples of syntactic restrictions proposed for defaults. The expressive powers of Reiter's default logic under the corresponding syntactic restrictions have been analyzed by Janhunen. It is quite natural that to ask if such restrictions affect the expressive power of variants of default logic. In this paper we analyze the expressive powers of semi-normal (SN) variants of Lukaszewicz's default logic (LDL). Among another variants of default logic are cumulative default logic (CDL) by Brewka as well as commitment to assumptions default logic and quasi-default logic (CADL and QDL) by Giordano and Martelli. The expressive powers of these three variants under the corresponding syntactic restrictions are also investigated. The framework is based on the notion of Janhunen's polynomial, faithful and modular (PFM) translation function that maps systematically theories of one nonmonotonic logic to theories of other such that the semantics of theories is preserved. The criteria for evaluating expressive powers of nonmonotonic logics are existence/nonexistence of PFM translations between such nonmonotonic logics. According to the measure provided by PFM translation we point out that semi-normality, in general (allowing defaults possessing no consistency conditions) may decrease expressive power of defaults in LDL and prove that semi-normality does not affect expressiveness of defaults in LDL *(where defaults have at least one consistency condition). For assertion default theories, expressive power may decrease in certain DL variants if syntactic resections (such as semi-normality) are introduced. The reason why such anomalies arise is that consistency conditions of applied defaults are recorded in the support of extensions. To deal with this problem we introduce a weaker notion of PFM translation function, called quasi-PFM translation function (QPFM). According to the measure provided by QPFM translations we analyze expressive powers of semi-normal defaults in CDL, CADL and QDL and establish that, in CDL and QDL, semi-normality does not affect expressiveness of defaults yet. For CADL, unfortunately, semi-normal defaults are less expressive than general defaults even if we adopt a weaker notion of faithfulness than one by Janhunen. Noticing that arbitrary consistency conditions (including empty consistency condition) are allowed for LDL, CADL and QDL, we also consider the possibility of reducing multiple consistency conditions to a single consistency condition.

#!Existing work on animation synthesis can be roughly split into two approaches, those that combine segments of motion-capture data, and those that perform inverse kinematics. In this paper, we present a method for performing animation synthesis of an articulated object (e.g. human body and a dog) from a minimal set of body joint positions, following the approach of inverse kinematics. We tackle this problem from a learning perspective. Firstly, we address the need for knowledge on the physical constraints of the articulated body, so as to avoid the generation of a physically impossible poses. A common solution is to heuristically specify the kinematic constraints for the skeleton model. In this paper however, the physical constraints of the articulated body are represented using a hierarchical cluster model learnt from a motion capture database. Additionally, we shall show that the learnt model automatically captures the correlation between different joints through simultaneous modelling of their angles. We then show how this model can be utilised to perform inverse kinematics in a simple and efficient manner. Crucially, we describe how IK is carried out from a minimal set of end-effector positions. Following this, we show how this "learnt inverse kinematics" framework can be used to perform animation syntheses on different types of articulated structures. To this end, the results presented include the retargeting of a flat surface walking animation to various uneven terrains to demonstrate the synthesis of a full human body motion from the positions of only the hands, feet and torso. Additionally, we show how the same method can be applied to the animation synthesis of a dog using only its feet and torso positions.

#!This discussion presents a new perspective of subspace independent component analysis (ICA). The notion of a function of cumulants (kurtosis) is generalized to vector kurtosis. This vector kurtosis is utilized in the subspace ICA algorithm to estimate subspace independent components. One of the main advantages of the presented approach is its computational simplicity. The experiments have shown promising results in estimating subspace independent components.

#!In cellular networks, an important practical issue is how to limit the handoff dropping probability efficiently. One possible approach is to perform dynamic bandwidth reservation based on mobility predictions. With the rapid advances in mobile positioning technology, and the widespread availability of digital road maps previously designed for navigational devices, we propose a predictive bandwidth reservation scheme built upon these timely opportunities. In contrast to the common practice of utilizing only incoming handoff predictions at each cell to compute the reservations, our scheme is more efficient as it innovatively utilizes both incoming and outgoing handoff predictions; it can meet the same target handoff dropping probability by blocking fewer new calls. The individual base stations are responsible for the computations, which are shown to be simple enough to be performed in real-time. We evaluate the scheme via simulation, along with five other schemes for comparison. Simulation results show that those schemes that rely on positioning information are significantly more efficient than those that do not. Our scheme's additional use of the road topology information further improves upon this advantage, bringing the efficiency closer to the bound set by a benchmark scheme that assumes perfect knowledge about future handoffs.

#!We present the use of a Modified Generalized Hough Transform (MGHT) and deformable contours for image data retrieval where a given contour, gray-scale, or color template image can be detected in the target image, irrespective of its position, size, rotation, and smooth deformation transformations. Potential template positions are found in the target image using our novel modified Generalized Hough Transform method that takes measurements from the template features by extending a line from each edge contour point in its gradient direction to the other end of the object. The gradient difference is used to create a relationship with the orientation and length of this line segment. Potential matching positions in the target image are then searched by also extending a line from each target edge point to another end along the normal, then looking up the measurements data from the template image. Positions with high votes become candidate positions. Each candidate position is used to find a match by allowing the template to undergo a contour transformation. The deformed template contour is matched with the target by measuring the similarity in contour tangent direction and the smoothness of the matching vector. The deformation parameters are then updated via a Bayesian algorithm to find the best match. To avoid getting stuck in a local minimum solution, a novel coarse-and-fine model for contour matching is included. Results are presented for real images of several kinds including bin picking and fingerprint identification.

#!Four algorithms, all variants of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), are proposed. The original one-measurement SPSA uses an estimate of the gradient of objective function L containing an additional bias term not seen in two-measurement SPSA. As a result, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the iterate convergence process has a bias term. We propose a one-measurement algorithm that eliminates this bias, and has asymptotic convergence properties making for easier comparison with the two-measurement SPSA. The algorithm, under certain conditions, outperforms both forms of SPSA with the only overhead being the storage of a single measurement. We also propose a similar algorithm that uses perturbations obtained from normalized Hadamard matrices. The convergence w.p. 1 of both algorithms is established. We extend measurement reuse to design two second-order SPSA algorithms and sketch the convergence analysis. Finally, we present simulation results on an illustrative minimization problem.

#!Although 2DLDA algorithm obtains higher recognition accuracy, a vital unresolved problem of 2DLDA is that it needs huge feature matrix for the task of face recognition. To overcome this problem, this paper presents an efficient approach for face image feature extraction, namely, (2D)^2LDA method. Experimental results on ORL and Yale database show that the proposed method obtains good recognition accuracy despite having less number of coefficients.

#!The lack of appropriate alternative text for web images remains a problem for blind users and others accessing the web with non-visual interfaces. The content contained within web images is vital for understanding many web sites but the majority are assigned either inaccurate alternative text or none at all. The capability to automatically judge the quality of alternative text has the promise to dramatically improve the accessibility of the web by bringing intelligence to three categories of interfaces: tools that help web authors verify that they have provided adequate alternative text for web images, systems that automatically produce and insert alternative text for web images, and screen reading software. In this paper we describe a classifier capable of measuring the quality of alternative text given only a few labeled training examples by automatically considering the image context.

#!K42 is one of the few recent research projects that is examining operating system design structure issues in the context of new whole-system design. K42 is open source and was designed from the ground up to perform well and to be scalable, customizable, and maintainable. The project was begun in 1996 by a team at IBM Research. Over the last nine years there has been a development effort on K42 from between six to twenty researchers and developers across IBM, collaborating universities, and national laboratories. K42 supports the Linux API and ABI, and is able to run unmodified Linux applications and libraries. The approach we took in K42 to achieve scalability and customizability has been successful.The project has produced positive research results, has resulted in contributions to Linux and the Xen hypervisor on Power, and continues to be a rich platform for exploring system software technology. Today, K42, is one of the key exploratory platforms in the DOE's FAST-OS program, is being used as a prototyping vehicle in IBM's PERCS project, and is being used by universities and national labs for exploratory research. In this paper, we provide insight into building an entire system by discussing the motivation and history of K42, describing its fundamental technologies, and presenting an overview of the research directions we have been pursuing.

#!Progress in reconfigurable hardware technology allows the implementation of complete SoCs in today's FPGAs. In the context design for reliability, software checkpointing is an effective methodology to cope with faults. In this paper, we systematically extend the concept of checkpointing known from software systems to hardware tasks running on reconfigurable devices. We will classify different mechanisms for hardware checkpointing and present formulas for estimating the hardware overhead. Moreover, we will reveal a tool that takes over the burden of modifying hardware modules for checkpointing. Post-synthesis results of applying our methodology to different hardware accelerators will be presented and the results will be compared with the theoretical estimations.

#!In recent years, overlay networks have proven a popular way of disseminating potentially large files from a single server S to a potentially large group of N end users via the Internet. A number of algorithms and protocols have been suggested, implemented and studied. In particular, much attention has been given to peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as BitTorrent [5], Slurpie [20], SplitStream [4], Bullet [11] and Avalanche [6]. The key idea is that the file is divided into M parts of equal size and that a given user may download any one of these - or, for Avalanche, linear combinations of these - either from the server or from a peer who has previously downloaded it.

#!In this paper, we present a subdivision-inspired scheme to construct generalized Sierpinski polyhedron. Unlike usual Sierpinski polyhedra construction schemes, which create either an infinite set of disconnected tetrahedra or a non-manifold polyhedron, our robust construction scheme creates one connected and manifold polyhedron. Moreover, unlike the original schemes, this new scheme can be applied to any manifold polyhedral mesh and based on the shape of this initial polyhedra a large variety of Sierpinski polyhedra can be obtained. Our basic scheme can be viewed as applying simplest subdivision scheme [23] to an input polyhedron, but retaining old vertices. The porous structure is then obtained by removing the refined facets of the simplest subdivision.

#!Comb-drive microactuator is widely used in MEMS devices and traditionally is made of silicon as structural material using silicon-based fabrication technology. Recent development in UV lithography of SU-8 has made it possible to fabricate the ultra high aspect ratio microstructures with excellent sidewall quality. In this paper, we report a low cost alternative to the silicon-based comb drive by using cured SU-8 polymer as structural material. The microactuator was designed to have a integrated structure without assembly or bonding. A unique integration fabrication process was successfully developed based on UV lithography of SU-8 and selectively metallizing SU-8 polymer structures. Preliminary experimental results have proved the feasibility of the microactuator and the fabrication technology.

#!Certain business objectives cannot be met without the interaction and communication between different systems. An interesting concept called system of systems (SoS), which aims to describe this interaction between systems has been gaining attention in the last few years. In this paper an extensive review of the literature is performed to capture the main characteristics associated to this concept in order to propose a new, more complete definition. This paper also proposes the use of distributed simulation through the High Level Architecture (HLA) rules to model and simulate systems of systems. We illustrate our idea with two different examples, a simplified supply chain network of a computer assembly and an aircraft initial sizing scenarios. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the significant advantages distributed simulation could offer over traditional simulation for the analysis of such complex systems.

In this paper, a new fuzzy-logic-based decision-making system for stock allocation (DMS&lowbar;SA) is presented, and the objective is to achieve the target DSC fill rate whilst incurring an acceptable total holding cost, or to achieve the target holding cost whilst with a certain level of fill rate. It is shown how DMS&lowbar;SA can be extended to be applied to a multi-echelon DSC. Copyright &copy; 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

#!Time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering by inhomogeneous, three-dimensional structures within a free space environment can be described by electric- and magnetic field, volume integral equations involving the free space Green function. A comprehensive set of Galerkin projection formulations (also known as moment methods) for the numerical solution of these equations is presented, together with comparative numerical results. Such formulations are widely used for particle scattering analysis, optical near field calculation, etc. Results are obtained with higher-order, divergence-and curl-conforming basis functions on iso-parametric, tetrahedral meshes. The results demonstrate that all formulations converge with similar accuracy in the case of an analytically-solvable test problem. When modeling flux densities as solution variables, it is argued that solenoidal function spaces should be used, rather than the standard divergence-conforming function spaces; this assertion is supported by the results. Some of the formulations involve solving for curl-conforming fields; such fields can be discretized with fewer unknowns than divergence-conforming ones, implying lower computational costs. Additionally, some formulations yield system matrices which are approximately halfway sparse, meaning that computational costs will be down by a factor of 2 when iterative solvers are employed, which is the case for the widely-used fast methods.

#*The operational risk tree methodology for managing operational risk exposure and measuring capital requirements
#@Henry Lee

#cProceedings of the 38th conference on Winter simulation
#index1924
#!Monte Carlo simulation is applied to measuring operational risk via a modified decision tree. The author describes a simulation based approach to measuring economic and regulatory capital for operational risk. Except in relatively rare cases where sufficient data exists, quantitative operational risk has grown to depend upon expert opinion via scenario analysis to fill in the missing data. The author explains the limitations and shortcomings of the current approach and details an alternative approach using a modified decision tree to address many of these shortcomings. While in the absence of data we still depend upon expert opinion, there is good reason to believe that the method of collecting this opinion can have great impact upon the confidence in, and reproducibility of, the results.

#!Diffusions of new products and technologies through social networks can be formalized as spreading of infectious diseases. However, while epidemiological models describe infection in terms of transmissibility, we propose a diffusion model that explicitly includes consumer decision-making affected by social influences and word-of-mouth processes. In our agent-based model consumers' probability of adoption depends on the external marketing effort and on the internal influence that each consumer perceives in his/her personal networks. Maintaining a given marketing effort and assuming its effect on the probability of adoption as linear, we can study how social processes affect diffusion dynamics and how the speed of the diffusion depends on the network structure and on consumer heterogeneity. First, we show that the speed of diffusion changes with the degree of randomness in the network. In markets with high social influence and in which consumers have a sufficiently large local network, the speed is low in regular networks, it increases in small-world networks and, contrarily to what epidemic models suggest, it becomes very low again in random networks. Second, we show that heterogeneity helps the diffusion. Ceteris paribus and varying the degree of heterogeneity in the population of agents simulation results show that the more heterogeneous the population, the faster the speed of the diffusion. These results can contribute to the development of marketing strategies for the launch and the dissemination of new products and technologies, especially in turbulent and fashionable markets.

#!Online retailing can offer several benefits. In order to realize these benefits, a commercial web site needs to ameliorate its deficiencies due to the absence of actual physical products. Although the use and popularity of the Internet continues to increase, it is still unclear how online retailers can establish effective online retailing strategies to capitalize on their benefits. For this clarification, this paper proposes a framework to categorize products according to consumers' involvement and information quality fitness. Involvement refers to the degree of psychological identification or emotional ties consumers have with a particular product. Information quality fitness refers to the extent to which a product can fit with shopper's requirements for online information. Thirty-six commercial products are empirically tested. It is found that products can be grouped into four categories such as 'complex,' 'intelligent,' 'light,' and 'simple.' This categorization can help understand product characteristics when they are sold via the Internet. Our finding implies that online retailers need to formulate their retailing strategies in view of these product categories.

#cNeural Networks
#index1949
#!To examine how the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) contributes to the decision process of the saccade direction, we recorded single-neuron activity while two monkeys performed two oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) tasks. In an ordinary ODR task, monkeys were required to make a memory-guided saccade to the cue location after a 3-s delay. In a self-selection version of the ODR task (S-ODR), four identical visual cues were presented simultaneously at the cue period, and monkeys were required to make a saccade toward any one of four directions after a 3-s delay. By comparing the same neuron's activity between two tasks, we found (1) neurons having directional cue-period activity in the ODR task did not show directionally selective activity in the S-ODR task, (2) neurons having directional pre-saccadic activity showed highly similar directional preferences in two tasks and exhibited temporal coupling between the onset of pre-saccadic activity and the initiation of saccadic eye movements, (3) neurons with directional delay-period activity in the ODR task exhibited similar directional preferences and showed gradual increase in the strength of the directional selectivity toward the end of the delay period in the S-ODR task. These results suggest that directional delay-period activity contributes to the decision process of the saccade direction in the S-ODR task, while directional cue-period and pre-saccadic activities do not. The gradual increase of the directional selectivity in delay-period activity might correspond to neural correlates of the decision process of the saccade direction in the S-ODR task.

#index1955
#!A tri-template-based codes (TTBC) method is proposed to reduce test cost of intellectual property (IP) cores. In order to reduce test data volume (TDV), the approach utilizes three templates, i.e., all 0, all 1, and the previously applied test data, for generating the subsequent test data by flipping the inconsistent bits. The approach employs a small number of test channels I to supply a large number of internal scan chains 2I-3 such that it can achieve significant reduction in test application time (TAT). Furthermore, as a non-intrusive and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) independent solution, the approach is suitable for IP core testing because it requires neither redesign of the core under test (CUT) nor running any additional ATPG for the encoding procedure. In addition, the decoder has low hardware overhead, and its design is independent of the CUT and the given test set. Theoretical analysis and experimental results for ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits have proven the efficiency of the proposed approach.

#!This paper describes a clustering technique using Self Organizing Maps and a two-dimensional histogram of the image. The two-dimensional histogram is found using the pixel value and the mean in the neighborhood. This histogram is fed to a self organizing map that divides the histogram into regions. Carefully selecting the number of regions, a scheme that allows an optimum optical recognition of texts can be found. The algorithm is specially suited for optical recognition application where a very high degree of confidence is needed. As an example application, the algorithm has been tested in a voting application, where a high degree of precision is required. Furthermore, the algorithm can be extended to any other thresholding or clustering applications.

#!Two common data representations are mostly used in intelligent data analysis, namely the vectorial and the pairwise representation. Pairwise data which satisfy the restrictive conditions of Euclidean spaces can be faithfully translated into a Euclidean vectorial representation by embedding. Non-metric pairwise data with violations of symmetry, reflexivity or triangle inequality pose a substantial conceptual problem for pattern recognition since the amount of predictive structural information beyond what can be measured by embeddings is unclear. We show by systematic modeling of non-Euclidean pairwise data that there exists metric violations which can carry valuable problem specific information. Furthermore, Euclidean and non-metric data can be unified on the level of structural information contained in the data. Stable component analysis selects linear subspaces which are particularly insensitive to data fluctuations. Experimental results from different domains support our pattern recognition strategy.

#!We present a scheduling procedure for the wire-bonding operation of a semiconductor assembly facility. The wire-bonding operation typically consists of a large number of unrelated parallel machines and is typically one of the bottlenecks in an assembly facility. The scheduling procedure is able to handle setup times, limited fixtures (clamp&paddles) and non-zero machine ready-times (initial work in progress). It is based on a simulator that generates a schedule and a Simulated Annealing approach to optimize the schedule. Some preliminary results from an implementation in a large assembly facility are given.

#cMicrosystem Technologies
#index1998
#!Molding technologies associated with fabricating macro scale polymer components such as injection molding and hot embossing have been adapted with considerable success for fabrication of polymer microparts. While the basic principles of the process remain the same, the precision with which the processing parameters need to be controlled especially in the case of molding high aspect ratio (HAR) polymer microparts into polymer sheets is much greater than in the case of macro scale parts. It is seen that the bulk effects of the mold insert fixture and molding machine have a dominant influence on the molding parameters and that differences in material parameters such as the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymer sheets are critical for the success and typically differ from sheet to sheet. This makes it very challenging to establish standard processing parameters for hot embossing of sheet polymers. In the course of this paper, a methodology for developing a hot embossing process for HAR microstructures based on known material properties and considering the cumulative behavior of mold, material, and machine will be presented. Using this method force&#x2013;temperature&#x2013;deflection curves were measured with the intent of fine tuning the hot embossing process. Tests were carried out for different materials using a dummy mold insert yielding information that could be directly transferred to the actual mold insert with minimum development time and no risk of damage to the actual microstructures.

#!Two techniques are described for approximating distributions on the positive half-line by combinations of exponentials. One is based on Jacobi polynomial expansions, and the other on the logbeta distribution. The techniques are applied to some well-known distributions (degenerate, uniform, Pareto, lognormal and others). In theory, the techniques yield sequences of combination of exponentials that always converge to the true distribution, but their numerical performance depends on the particular distribution being approximated. An error bound is given in the case the logbeta approximations. Copyright &copy; 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

#!Despite recent advances in fluid animation, producing small-scale detail of turbulent water still remains challenging. In this paper, we extend the well-accepted particle level set method in an attempt to integrate the dynamic behavior of splashing water easily into a fluid animation system. Massless marker particles that still escape from the main body of water, in spite of the level set correction, are transformed into water particles to represent subcell-level features that are hard to capture with a limited grid resolution. These physical particles are then moved in the air through a particle simulation system that, combined with the level set, creates realistic turbulent splashing. In the rendering stage, the particle's physical properties such as mass and velocity are exploited to generate a natural appearance of water droplets and spray. In order to visualize the hybrid water, represented in both level set and water particles, we also extend a Monte Carlo ray tracer so that the particle agglomerates are smoothed, thickened, if necessary, and rendered efficiently. The effectiveness of the presented technique is demonstrated with several examples of pictures and animations.

#!We present a novel algorithm to perform continuous collision detection for articulated models. Given two discrete configurations of the links of an articulated model, we use an "arbitrary in-between motion" to interpolate its motion between two successive time steps and check the resulting trajectory for collisions. Our approach uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic bounding-volume hierarchy (D-BVH) culling based on interval arithmetic; (2) culling refinement using the swept volume of line swept sphere (LSS) and graphics hardware accelerated queries; (3) exact contact computation using OBB-trees and continuous collision detection between triangular primitives. The overall algorithm computes the time of collision, contact locations and prevents any interpenetration between the articulated model with the environment. We have implemented the algorithm and tested its performance on a 2.4 GHz Pentium PC with 1 Gbyte of RAM and a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5800 graphics card. In practice, our algorithm is able to perform accurate and continuous collision detection between articulated models and complex environments at nearly interactive rates.

#!To disseminate data to a heterogeneous body of receivers efficiently, congestion control protocols for IP multicast compose a session from several multicast groups and prescribe guidelines that enable each re ceiver to subscribe to an appropriate subset of the groups. However, a misbehaving receiver can ignore the group subscription rules and inflate its subscription to acquire unfairly high throughput. In this paper, we present the first solution for the problem of inflated subscription. Our design guards access to multicast groups with dynamic keys and consists of two independent components: DELTA (Distribution of ELigibility To Access)-a novel method for in-band distribution of group keys to receivers that are eligible to access the groups according to the congestion control protocol, and SIGMA (Secure Internet Group Management Architecture)-a generic architecture for key-based group access at edge routers. We apply DELTA and SIGMA to derive robust versions of prominent RLM and FLID-DL protocols.

#!Dendritic solidification of pure materials from an undercooled melt is studied using the extended finite element method/ level set method for modelling the thermal problem and a volume-averaged stabilized finite element formulation for modelling fluid flow. The extended finite element method using evolving enrichment functions allows accurate modelling of the discontinuous thermal conditions at the moving sharp freezing front thus capturing its motion precisely. The solution of the velocity field in the melt is obtained assuming that the sharp-interface is diffused over the length of two finite elements. The methodology presented is shown to be an effective tool for capturing the interface phenomena and freezing interface growth using a single uniform finite element grid. The whole formulation is packaged into a flexible, modular and parallel library with the ability to incorporate new physics. Comparisons with other numerical methods as well as analytical results emphasize the fidelity of the method in modelling the underlying physical phenomena and growth mechanisms. Various examples of dendritic growth in two- and three-dimensions are presented.

In particular we discuss Environmental Decision Support Systems (EDSS). In the last decade, EDSS emerged as a suitable software tool to support control decision&dash;making to maximize the performance of a system and to minimize the negative impact of faults. Knowledge Management in Environmental Decision Support Systems appear as a necessity for EDSS users to place guarantees on the system's behavior but these methodologies are still under&dash;explored.

The operating system is so full of industrial-strength routing protocols and IP innovations that those treading into the world of JUNOS will need clarification, explanation, and a showcase example or two. Look no further. This JUNOS Cookbook provides it all and more.Yes, you can mine through the 5,000 pages of documentation or take a two-thousand-dollar training course, but JUNOS's interprocess sophistication can be baffling unless you know the shortcuts and tricks, as well as those rays of illuminating comprehension that can come only from those who live with it. JUNOS Cookbook is the first comprehensive book about JUNOS software and it provides over 200 time-saving step-by-step techniques including discussions about the processes and alternative ways to perform the same task. It's been tested and tech-reviewed by field engineers who know how to take JUNOS out for a spin and it's applicable to the entire line of M-, T-, and J-series routers. JUNOS Cookbook will not only pay for itself the first few times you use it, it will make your network easier to manage and update. "Aviva Garrett has done a tremendous job of distilling the features of JUNOS software in a form that will be useful for a wide audience-students, field engineers, network architects, and other networking professionals alike will benefit from this book. For many people, this is the only book on JUNOS they will need." Pradeep Sindhu, CTO and Founder, Juniper Networks"This cookbook is superb. Aviva Garrett has masterfully assembled a complete set of practical real-world examples with step-by-step instructions. Security, management, routing: it's all here!"

#!Energy efficiency becomes increasingly important in today's high-performance storage systems. It can be challenging to save energy and improve performance at the same time in conventional (i.e. single-rotation-rate) disk-based storage systems. Most existing solutions compromise performance for energy conservation. In this paper, we propose a redundancy-based, two-level I/O cache architecture called RIMAC to address this problem. The idea of RIMAC is to enable data on the standby disk to be recovered by accessing data in the two-level I/O cache or on currently active/idle disks. At both cache and disk levels, RIMAC dynamically transforms accesses toward standby disks by exploiting parity redundancy in parity-based redundant disk arrays. Because I/O requests that require physical accesses on standby disks involve long waiting time and high power consumption for disk spin-up (tens of seconds for SCSI disks), transforming those requests to accesses in a two-level, collaborative I/O cache or on active disks can significantly improve both energy efficiency and performance.In RIMAC, we developed i) two power-aware read request transformation schemes called Transformable Read in Cache (TRC) and Transformable Read on Disk (TRD), ii) a power-aware write request transformation policy for parity update and iii) a second-chance parity cache replacement algorithm to improve request transformation rate. We evaluated RIMAC by augmenting a validated storage system simulator, disksim. For several real-life server traces including HP's cello 99, TPC-D and SPC's search engine, RIMAC is shown to reduce energy consumption by up to 33% and simultaneously improve the average response time by up to 30%.

#*Performance of Super-Orthogonal Convolutional Coding for Ultra-Wideband Systems in Multipath and Multiuser Channels
#@Tomoko Matsumoto,Ryuji Kohno

#index2059
#%603912
#!This paper investigates the application of super-orthogonal convolutional codes (SOCC) to a direct-sequence based ultra- wideband (DS-UWB) system under a realistic environment including inter-symbol interference (ISI) and multiuser interference (MUI). The effect of MUI and ISI on the performance of SOCC is analyzed by using both maximum ratio combining (MRC) RAKE receiver and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) RAKE receiver followed by matched filter receiver. The analysis shows that in the case of employing simple MRC-RAKE receiver, the performance of SOCC is ffected by MUI and ISI because of the short length of the spreading sequence. In order to combat MUI and ISI, a code-hopping scheme is proposed in conjunction with SOCC. The results show that SOCC scheme outperforms the higher-rate conventional convolutional coded scheme for multipath and multiple access channels. Furthermore, the use of MMSE-RAKE receiver to suppress interference is analyzed and the subsequent increase of the system capacity is observed.

#!Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is gaining a lot of attention these days, as more companies and individuals switch from standard telephone service to phone service via the Internet. The reason is simple: A single network to carry voice and data is easier to scale, maintain, and administer. As an added bonus, it's also cheaper, because VoIP is free of the endless government regulations and tariffs imposed upon phone companies. VoIP is simply overflowing with hack potential, and VoIP Hacks is the practical guide from O'Reilly that presents these possibilities to you. It provides dozens of hands-on projects for building a VoIP network, showing you how to tweak and customize a multitude of exciting things to get the job done. Along the way, you'll also learn which standards and practices work best for your particular environment. Among the quick and clever solutions showcased in the book are those for: gauging VoIP readiness on an enterprise network using SIP, H.323, and other signaling specifications providing low-layer security in a VoIP environment employing IP hardphones, analog telephone adapters, and softPBX servers dealing with and avoiding the most common VoIP deployment mistakes In reality, VoIP Hacks contains only a small subset of VoIP knowledge-enough to serve as an introduction to the world of VoIP and teach you how to use it to save money, be more productive, or just impress your friends. If you love to tinker and optimize, this is the one technology, and the one book, you must investigate.

#!We consider a fundamental scheduling problem in a multiserver stochastic network consisting of 2 classes of customers and 2 classes of servers. Customers of class k arrive to queue k according to a Poisson process with rate &lambda;k, k = 1, 2. The service times of class k customers at class &ell; servers are i.i.d. following an exponential distribution with mean &mu;k&ell;-1, &forall;k, &ell; = 1, 2, where 0 < &mu;11, &mu;12, &mu;22 < &infin; and &mu;21 = 0. Hence, class 1 customers can be served at both classes of servers, but class 2 customers can only be served at class 2 servers. A FCFS queueing discipline is employed at each queue. The customer arrival and service processes are mutually independent of each other and of all resource allocation decisions.

#!Dialogue systems for health communication hold out the promise of providing intelligent assistance to patients through natural interfaces that require no training to use. But in order to make the development of such systems cost effective, we must be able to use generic techniques and components which are then specialized as needed to the specific health problem and patient population. In this paper, we describe Chester, a prototype intelligent assistant that interacts with its user via conversational natural spoken language to provide them with information and advice regarding their prescribed medications. Chester builds on our prior experience constructing conversational assistants in other domains. The emphasis of this paper is on the portability of our generic spoken dialogue technology, and presents a case study of the application of these techniques to the development of a dialogue system for health communication.

#!We describe the results of numerical experiments evaluating the efficiency of variance estimators based on integrated sample paths. The idea behind the estimators is to compute a vector of integrated paths and combine them to form an estimator of the time-average variance constant that is used, for example, in the construction of confidence intervals. When used in conjunction with batching, the approach generalizes the method of non-overlapping batch means. Compared with non-overlapping batch means, the estimators require longer to compute, have smaller variance and larger bias. We show that for long enough simulation run lengths, the efficiency (the reciprocal of running time multiplied by mean-squared error) of integrated path estimators can be much greater than that of non-overlapping batch means; the numerical experiments show an efficiency improvement by up to a factor of ten.

#!The cascade of two baseline networks in tandem is a rearrangeable network. The cascade of two omega networks appended with a certain interconnection pattern is also rearrangeable. These belong to the general problem: for what banyan-type network (i.e., bit-permuting unique-routing network) is the tandem cascade a rearrangeable network? We relate the problem to the trace and guide of banyan-type networks. Let τ denote the trace permutation of a 2n × 2n banyan-type network and γ the guide permutation of it. This paper proves that rearrangeability of the tandem cascade of the network is solely determined by the transposition τγ-1. Such a permutation is said to be tandem rearrangeable when the tandem cascade is indeed rearrangeable. We identify a few tandem rearrangeable permutations, each implying the rearrangeability of the tandem cascade of a wide class of banyan-type networks.

#!We investigate the effect of curvature on the accuracy of schemes used to transfer loads along the interface in coupled fluid-solid simulations involving non-matching meshes. We analyze two types of load transfer schemes for the coupled system: (a) point-to-element projection schemes and (b) common-refinement schemes. The accuracy of these schemes over the curved interface is assessed with the aid of static and transient problems. We show that the point-to-element projection schemes may yield inaccurate load transfer from the source fluid mesh to the target solid mesh, leading to a weak instability in the form of spurious oscillations and overshoots in the interface solution. The common-refinement scheme resolves this problem by providing an accurate transfer of discrete interface conditions across non-matching meshes. We show theoretically that the accurate transfer preserves the stability of the coupled system while maintaining the energy conservation over a reference interface. Finally, we introduce simple analytical error functions which correlate well with the numerical errors of the load transfer schemes.

#!This paper discusses a research project in which social scientists were involved both as analysts and supporters during a pilot with a new wireless nursing call system. The case thus exemplifies an attempt to participate in developing dependable health care systems and offers insight into the challenges of developing and supporting such systems. The analysis proposes that while dependability is not simply a technical issue, neither is it something, which can be improved merely by adding a social dimension. Instead, it argues that dependability is a relative concept, which may mean different things conditional on how it is specified in practice and who gets to do this. This relativity makes it important to relate the question of how to support dependable health care systems to an analysis of both the politics of technology within specific projects and to the politics of discourse, through which the researcher becomes involved in such projects.

#!With the advent of next-generation, bandwidth-intensive multimedia applications such as HDTV, interactive distance learning, and movie broadcasts from studios, it is becoming imperative to exploit the enormous bandwidth promised by the rapidly growing wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) technology. These applications require multicasting of information from a source to several destination nodes which should be performed judiciously to conserve expensive network resources. In this study, we investigate two switch architectures to support multicasting in a WDM network: one using an opaque (optical-electronic-optical approach and the other using a transparent (all-optical) approach. For both these switch architectures, we present mathematical formulations for routing and wavelength assignment of several light-tree-based multicast sessions on a given network topology at a globally optimal cost. We expand our work to also accommodate: 1) fractional-capacity sessions (where a session's capacity is a fraction of a wavelength channel's bandwidth, thereby leading to "traffic-groomed" multicast sessions) and 2) sparse splitting constraints, i.e., limited fanout of optical splitters and limited number of such splitters at each node. We illustrate the solutions obtained on different networks by solving these optimization problems, which turn out to be mixed integer linear programs (MILPs). Because the MILP is computationally intensive and does not scale well for large problem sizes, we also propose fast heuristics for establishing a set of multicast sessions in a network with or without wavelength converters and with fractional-capacity sessions. We find that, for all scenarios, the heuristics which arrange the sessions in ascending order with respect to destination set size and/or cost perform better in terms of network resource usage than the heuristics which arrange the sessions in descending order.

#!The quest for reliable integration of initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a long-standing problem in numerical analysis. At one end of the reliability spectrum are fixed stepsize methods implemented using standard floating point, where the onus lies entirely with the user to ensure the stepsize chosen is adequate for the desired accuracy. At the other end of the reliability spectrum are rigorous interval-based methods, that can provide provably correct bounds on the error of a numerical solution. This rigour comes at a price, however: interval methods are generally two to three orders of magnitude more expensive than fixed stepsize floating-point methods. Along the spectrum between these two extremes lie various methods of different expense that estimate and control some measure of the local errors and adjust the stepsize accordingly. In this article, we continue previous investigations into a class of interpolants for use in Runge-Kutta methods that have a defect function whose qualitative behavior is asymptotically independent of the problem being integrated. In particular the point, in a step, where the maximum defect occurs as h &rarr; 0 is known a priori. This property allows the defect to be monitored and controlled in an efficient and robust manner even for modestly large stepsizes. Our interpolants also have a defect with the highest possible order given the constraints imposed by the order of the underlying discrete formula. We demonstrate the approach on three Runge-Kutta methods of orders 5, 6, and 8, and provide Fortran and preliminary Matlab interfaces to these three new integrators. We also consider how sensitive such methods are to roundoff errors. Numerical results for four problems on a range of accuracy requests are presented.

#!We discussed previously the need for a risk analysis tool which could account simultaneously for the variety of hazards produced by the explosion of a space launch vehicle. We particularly argued that by analyzing separately the risks posed by the pressure of the explosion blast, the dispersion of toxic gases and the fragments cloud, current practices fail to account for the interdependencies between those hazards, potentially miscalculating the overall risk on the public and the surrounding infrastructure. In this work we set two objectives to expand on our claim. The first is to propose a methodology based on Distribution Envelope Determination (DEnv) to address the above need. The second on the other hand focuses on describing the ongoing software development activities aimed at implementing this methodology as an ArcGIS platform component.

There are three query processing methods in the database broadcasting system: (i) the server processes a query and then broadcasts the query result to the client, (ii) the client stores all data that are necessary to process the query and then processes it locally, and (iii) the server and the client collaborate in processing the query. Since the performance of each method changes according to the situation such as the interval of query generation and the size of query results, it is difficult to choose the optimal method among them statically. In this paper, we propose new query processing methods which dynamically change the order of queries submitted in the queue at the server and also change processing methods for the queries according to the deadline of queries and the system situation. These methods improve the success rate as well as reduce the response time in most cases. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!Today more and more essential processes are conducted across enterprise borders, inducing additional challenges in terms of different languages, process types and ontology. Business Process Modelling (BPM) and Simulation are well-understood methods to analyze and optimize the processes within an enterprise. However, they can also be used for cross-organizational application, especially if they are combined with reference structures. This paper explains techniques which support cross-enterprise design and configuration based on Reference Models. Thereby, different approaches such as SCOR, the Integrated Enterprise Modelling (IEM) and a specific Distributed Simulation Method are used and integrated into a consistent Reference Model approach. The application of this approach is illustrated with different projects which each focus on a specific aspect of the supply chain design and configuration.

#!Clustering algorithms are routinely used in biomedical disciplines, and are a basic tool in bioinformatics. Depending on the task at hand, there are two most popular options, the central partitional techniques and the agglomerative hierarchical clustering techniques and their derivatives. These methods are well studied and well established. However, both categories have some drawbacks related to data dimensionality (for partitional algorithms) and to the bottom-up structure (for hierarchical agglomerative algorithms). To overcome these limitations, motivated by the problem of gene expression analysis with DNA microarrays, we present a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on a completely different principle, which is the analysis of shared farthest neighbors. We present a framework for clustering using ranks and indexes, and introduce the shared farthest neighbors (SFN) clustering criterion. We illustrate the properties of the method and present experimental results on different data sets, using the strategy of evaluating data clustering by extrinsic knowledge given by class labels.

#!Welcome to WOSP'07 in the beautiful city of Buenos Aires!WOSP'07 is a venue for active interchange of ideas from people working in various fields of computing and telecommunications. Focusing on the intersection of software and performance, this international workshop brings together software engineers, developers, performance analysts and modelers who study, create and use tools and methods that address the new issues in the field of software performance. Modern distributed applications, often based on mobility, with heterogeneous and intermittent connections, add unforeseen challenges every day, and demand new approaches for modeling and analyzinge the performance characteristics of design alternatives in all the phases of the software lifecycle. However, this achievingement the goal is often defied often challenging by because of increasing system complexity, rapidly evolving software technologies, short time to market, incomplete documentation, and poorly defined requirements.WOSP'07 is the sixth in the series of International Workshop on Software and Performance that began in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1998. This year the workshop is being held for the first time in South America, and we are fortunate to have it in Argentina. We hope you will take the time to enjoy the city in addition to the workshop. Therefore, welcome to WOSP'07 in the beautiful city of Buenos Aires!This year's technical program is as strong as ever. We received 39 submissions which were thoroughly reviewed by an expert program committee. From these 13 were accepted as full papers, 4 were accepted as experience papers and 8 as short papers. The workshop will be is structured in 8 sessions over covering 3 days. Session topics span from a range of domains including Software Performance Modeling and Engineering, through Resource-Awareness to and Performance of Mobile Systems. Two sessions will be dedicated to short papers. We are confident that the body of knowledge selected for WOSP'07 will contribute, on one hand, to the advancement of the state of the art in the field and, on the other hand, to filling the gap between the academic and industrial worlds. Only theise synergy between these two worlds may allow can ensure that to software performance modeling and analysis to will become stable standard practices in the software development processes.In addition to papers, the workshop includes tutorials and working sessions. We are also pleased to have two distinguished keynote speakers, that are: Dr. Rich Friedrich from HP and Dr. Carlo Ghezzi from Politecnico di Milano.

#!While moving our fingertip over a fine surface we experience a sensation that gives us an idea of its properties. A satisfactory simulation of this feeling is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we describe a rendering strategy based on vibrations that play an important role in the tactile exploration of fine surfaces. To produce appropriate excitation patterns we use an array of vibrating contactor pins. Similar to the colour model in computer graphics, we simulate arbitrary vibrations as a superposition of only two sinewaves. Each sinewave is intended for the excitation of a specific population of mechanoreceptors. We carried out first tests of our rendering strategy on Brownian surfaces of different fractal dimensions.

#!We introduce a method for constructing optimally universal hash families and equivalently RBIBDs. As a consequence of our construction we obtain minimal optimally universal hash families, if the cardinalities of the universe and the range are powers of the same prime. A corollary of this result is that the necessary conditions for the existence of an RBIBD with parameters v, k, λ, namely v ≡ 0 (mod k) and λ(v - 1) ≡ 0(mod k - 1), are sufficient, if v and k are powers of the same prime. As an application of our construction, we show that the k-MAXCUT algorithm of Hofmeister and Lefmann [A combinatorial design approach to MAXCUT, Random Struct. Algorithms 9 (1996) 163-173] can be implemented such that it has a polynomial running time, in the case that the number of vertices and k are powers of the same prime.

#!The mobility of the nodes in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a crucial factor in the performance studies of communication protocols for these kind of networks. For this reason, researchers usually use a randomized node movement model, such as the Random Way-Point Model [6], in the process of designing or analyzing the behavior of their protocols. Since movement is not very predictable in these scenarios, they generally serve as a "worst case assumption" of node mobility concerning communication protocol performance in the sense that a positive correlation between performance in an RWP scenario and an arbitrary scenario exists. Additionally, RWP is an analytically well-understood mobility scheme and the movements can be generated very easily with tools complementary to most of the common network simulators.

#!In this paper, we propose a new approach for mitigation of worm propagation through tactical Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) which is based upon performance signatures and software rejuvenation. Three application performance signature and software rejuvenation algorithms are proposed and analyzed. These algorithms monitor critical applications' responsiveness and trigger actions for software rejuvenation when host resources degrade due to a co-resident worm competing for host resources. We analyze the effectiveness of our algorithms through analytic modeling and detailed, extensive simulation studies. The key performance metrics investigated are application response time, mean time between rejuvenations and the steady state probability of host infection. We also use simulation models to investigate several design and parameter tuning issues. We investigate the relationship between the rate at which the application performance monitors can detect out-of-specification applications and the rate of worm propagation in the network.

#!Incorporating user-oriented features usually found only in much larger computers, the first models of the Eclipse line, the $100 and $200, use a high speed micro-programmed central processor, and can run with either; core or semiconductor memories, or both. The core and semiconductor memories are available with an error detection and correction feature that can find and correct; single bit errors caused by the computer. The semiconductor memories use a high-speed cache to increase memory speed. The Eclipse $100, the smaller of the two computers, will be used by oems or by end users who need a smaller system to meet their requirements. The Eclipse $100 is 5-1/4 inches high, and holds six standard Data General printed circuit boards. It costs $9200, with 16k bytes of core memory, and $10,700 with 16k bytes of semiconductor memory. Eclipse $100 deliveries will begin in December. The Eclipse $200, a system-oriented computer that can hold 16 printed circuit boards, will be used by system builders or end users who will build large scale computing systems around it. The Eclipse $200 is 10-1/2 inches high, and costs $16,300 with 32k bytes of core memory, and $19,300 with 32k bytes of semiconductor memory. Deliveries of the Eclipse $200 will begin in February. The instruction set of both Eclipse computers is microprogrammed in the central processor. There are over 40 new instruction in the Eclipse computers. Programs written on Nova computers will run on either the Eclipse $100 or $200. The central processor includes a Writeable Control Store making up to 256, 56-bit words available to write specialized micro-programmed instructions. The instruction set is enhanced to help programmers writing in assembly language or high-level language programs. Hardware memory stacks, supported by comprehensive instructions, make programming more efficient, while block, word, byte and bit manipulation instructions improve system performance. Instructions are both single word and double word instructions.

#!The popularity of digital cameras continues to grow exponentially. They are now more powerful, feature rich, and affordable--turning digital photography into a mainstream interest. And with Photoshop Elements, Adobe has created the most popular photo-editing program on the planet. Learning how to work Photoshop Elements and manage digital photos can be a challenge for anyone just getting started--from the hobbyist to the pro photographer. With the latest Photoshop Elements 4 update, Adobe delivers a powerful new program that provides photo editing and organizing functionality with improved performance. The updated version also includes new, more intuitive features that are streamlined and easier to use--when the photographer has the right learning tool in hand. With Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual, author Barbara Brundage has written the perfect digital photography guide. In a clear, easy-to-read format, the author provides step-by-step instruction so readers can learn what they need to do to edit their photos successfully and manage their collection. This new edition also includes more than a dozen downloadable images so readers can practice using the editing tools. Readers will master useful editing techniques--from the most common to the advanced:Automatically correct red eye and skin tonesSelect and extract complex objects with the Magic Selection Brush and The Magic ExtractorCreate photomontagesRestore old photographsPost photos on the webManage and archive an entire collectionDesign a custom slide show with panning and zooming capabilitiesOnce photographers learn how to edit their photos successfully, they'll also learn how to post them online or upload them to the Kodak EasyShare Gallery for use in creating personal mailing lists, post cards, calendars, and much more. Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual, is for any photographer interested in learning the right editing techniques for producing and sharing beautiful digital photography.Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual covers the Windows version of the software only. When we published the book, there was no Mac version of the software (as there is now), and for various reasons, we've been unable to update this edition to include the Mac version. Nonetheless, if you're on a Mac, you can use this book. Just substitute Command for Ctrl, and Option for Alt whenever you see keystroke shortcuts, and about 98 percent of the Editor functions will work the same. The sections on the Organizer only apply to Windows because the Mac version has no Organizer.

#*Discovering Interesting Relationships among Deep Web Databases: A Source-Biased Approach
#@James Caverlee,Ling Liu,Daniel Rocco

#cWorld Wide Web
#index2281
#!The escalation of deep web databases has been phenomenal over the last decade, spawning a growing interest in automated discovery of interesting relationships among available deep web databases. Unlike the "surface" web of static pages, these deep web databases provide data through a web-based query interface and account for a huge portion of all web content. This paper presents a novel source-biased approach to efficiently discover interesting relationships among web-enabled databases on the deep web. Our approach supports a relationship-centric view over a collection of deep web databases through source-biased database analysis and exploration. Our source-biased approach has three unique features: First, we develop source-biased probing techniques, which allow us to determine in very few interactions whether a target database is relevant to the source database by probing the target with very precise probes. Second, we introduce source-biased relevance metrics to evaluate the relevance of deep web databases discovered, to identify interesting types of source-biased relationships for a collection of deep web databases, and to rank them accordingly. The source-biased relationships discovered not only present value-added metadata for each deep web database but can also provide direct support for personalized relationship-centric queries. Third, but not least, we also develop a performance optimization using source-biased probing with focal terms to further improve the effectiveness of the basic source-biased model. A prototype system is designed for crawling, probing, and supporting relationship-centric queries over deep web databases using the source-biased approach. Our experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed source-biased analysis and discovery model, showing that the source-biased approach outperforms query-biased probing and unbiased probing.

#!The microprogrammed Data General Eclipse S/200 computer is available with a writable control store (WCS). The WCS feature of the Eclipse is an extension of the microprogrammed control logic of the computer's central processing unit. It allows a user to implement specialized instructions at a very low level. Its use is however, discouraged since Data General does not provide software support for the WCS feature. A microassembler was written to alleviate this problem on the Memphis State System.

#*Embedded Image Coding Using Context Adaptive Wavelet Difference Reduction
#@Poonlap Lamsrichan,Teerapat Sanguankotchakorn
#t2007
#cIEICE - Transactions on Information and Systems
#index2285
#!It is well-known that one of the best wavelet-based image compression techniques, called Wavelet Difference Reduction--WDR, has both simple algorithm and comparative rate-distortion results comparing to other coders in the literature. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to enhance the performance of WDR coder in a very efficient way. The methodology is highly based on the context adaptive model. High-order statistical context modeling is used for significant coefficients prediction by scanning order adaptation of WDR. In binary mode, the coder is clearly better than Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT). A new conditional Arithmetic Coding (AC) using array of contexts is specifically designed for WDR-based coder. Based on our simulation results of all images in the test set which covers various types of images, it is apparent that our proposed coder in AC mode generates the rate-distortion results that are superior to those of all other WDR-based coders in the literature. Furthermore, it is very competitive to SPIHT-AC and JPEG2000, the best coders, at all bit rates.

#!This paper reports on an evaluation of the usability designer role as applied in two Swedish systems development organisations. The role was initially defined by us, but evolved in these two organisations. We conducted interviews with usability designers, project managers and a user representative. Our main research question was whether or not the introduction of a usability designer has been successful in terms of changes in the systems development process and the impact the role has had on products, projects and organisations. To some extent, the role has met our expectations and intentions for instance, in helping the usability designers shift their focus towards design, and assume some kind of ''users' advocate'' role. But in other ways, the role ''failed''. The usability designers in our study are still facing the kind of problems and obstacles that usability professionals have always had to deal with.

#!The key to mastering any Unix system, especially Linux and Mac OS X, is a thorough knowledge of shell scripting. Scripting is a way to harness and customize the power of any Unix system, and it's an essential skill for any Unix users, including system administrators and professional OS X developers. But beneath this simple promise lies a treacherous ocean of variations in Unix commands and standards. bash Cookbook teaches shell scripting the way Unix masters practice the craft. It presents a variety of recipes and tricks for all levels of shell programmers so that anyone can become a proficient user of the most common Unix shell -- the bash shell -- and cygwin or other popular Unix emulation packages. Packed full of useful scripts, along with examples that explain how to create better scripts, this new cookbook gives professionals and power users everything they need to automate routine tasks and enable them to truly manage their systems -- rather than have their systems manage them.

#!This paper presents a novel anomaly detection and clustering algorithm for the network intrusion detection based on factor analysis and Mahalanobis distance. Factor analysis is used to uncover the latent structure of a set of variables. The Mahalanobis distance is used to determine the "similarity" of a set of values from an "unknown" sample to a set of values measured from a collection of "known" samples. By utilizing factor analysis and Mahalanobis distance, we developed an algorithm 1) to identify outliers based on a trained model, and 2) to cluster attacks by abnormal features.

#!This paper presents the development and the application of simulation models for air cargo terminal operations. As air cargo volume is fast increasing in recent years, air cargo terminals which handle cargos for carriers face challenges to streamline their operations. Air cargo terminals employ diverse storage media and are also equipped with various material handling equipments. Due to the complex and stochastic nature of terminal operations, which makes formulation of analytical model difficult, in this study, simulation models are developed to analyze the air cargo terminal operations. We first employ timed CPN (Colour Petri nets) to model the terminal operations, and then the corresponding simulation model will be developed. In order to validate this simulation model, we run the model based on actual cargo retrieval schedules obtained from an air cargo terminal. The results show that this model provides a good estimate of the terminal performance. The model is then employed to analyze the performance of the airline assignment policy for the objective of minimizing the cargo processing times, and the results show that the proposed policy significantly improves the operational performance of air cargo terminals. Second, the simulation model is employed to analyze the performance of an AS/ RS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System), and the performance of the proposed storage policy is compared with that of the current policy. The simulation experiment also validates the optimal parameter value from the analytic model. The developed models simulate air cargo terminal operations effectively and efficiently, and will aid future studies in the design and control of terminal operations.

You can upgrade the hard drive for more hours of recording, log in to the serial port for command-line access to programming data, log files, closed-captioning data, display graphics on the TiVo screen, and even play MP3s. Note: Not all TiVos are the same. The original TiVo, the Series 1, is the most hackable TiVo out there; it's a box thrown together with commodity parts and the TiVo code is running on open hardware. The Series 2 TiVo, the most commonly sold TiVo today, is not open. You won't see hacks in this book that involve modifying Series 2 software.

#!Dynamic data-driven application systems (DDDAS) integrate computer simulations with experimental observations to study phenomena with greater speed and accuracy than could be achieved by either experimentation or simulation alone. One of the key challenges behind DDDAS is automatically adapting simulations when experimental data indicates that a simulation must change. Coercion is a semi-automated simulation adaptation approach that can be automated further if elements of the simulation called flexible points are described in advance. In this paper, we use a number of DDDAS adaptation examples to identify the information that needs to be captured about flexible points in order to support coercion.

Shadowing can thus be used as a form of backward error analysis for numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations. This survey introduces the reader to shadowing with a detailed tour of shadowing algorithms and practical results obtained over the last 15 years.

#!In this paper, a novel parametric and global image histogram thresholding method is presented. It is based on the estimation of the statistical parameters of ''object'' and ''background'' classes by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, under the assumption that these two classes follow a generalized Gaussian (GG) distribution. The adoption of such a statistical model as an alternative to the more common Gaussian model is motivated by its attractive capability to approximate a broad variety of statistical behaviors with a small number of parameters. Since the quality of the solution provided by the iterative EM algorithm is strongly affected by initial conditions (which, if inappropriately set, may lead to unreliable estimation), a robust initialization strategy based on genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed. Experimental results obtained on simulated and real images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

#index2384
#!Traditionally, inventory problems for the vendor and the buyer are treated separately. In modern enterprises, however, the integration of vendor---buyer inventory system is an important issue. This co-operative approach to inventory management contributes to the success of supply chain management by minimizing the joint inventory cost. The joint inventory cost and the response time can further be reduced when the buyer orders and the vendor replenishes the required items just in time (JIT) for their consumption. The inclusion of the JIT concept in this model contributes significantly to a joint inventory cost reduction. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis are carried out. The derived results show an impressive cost reduction when compared with Goyal's model.

#!Content access control within hierarchies is an ubiquitous problem. It occurs each time that a set of users have access to a set of resources. The users do not have necessarily the same access rights. Allowing users to access only resources to which they are entitled in a scalable and efficient way is the objective of our key management scheme. In this paper, we introduce the hierarchical group communication, give an abstract model of the hierarchical group communication. We present and classify the most important works on key management for hierarchical groups from the multicast and information technology communities. Then, we propose an efficient operational solution to implement the hierarchical group communication model and proof its security and proof its security.

#!The second book in this acclaimed series from noted photographer and digital imaging expert Eddie Tapp delves into color management, a topic that has needlessly become a mystery to experienced digital photographers, whether they're avid amateurs, serious students, or working professionals. With his easygoing yet authoritative style, Eddie sheds light on this topic and supplies an understanding of color management that readers apply to their own work. Clear and concise, this highly visual book explains how color management is a part of the overall photographic workflow. Eddie demonstrates the three stages of color managed workflow, from choosing a color space, to calibrating your devices, to applying appropriate profiles, and shows you exactly what you need to know and why you need to know it. Color management scientist Rick Lucas contributes a chapter on the hard-core technical aspects. Other books on color management are much too long, involved and intimidating. This absorbing book sets the right tone and supplies you with key answers quickly. Our Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography book series brings you the focused knowledge you need on specific areas of digital photography. Acknowledged as one of the premier trainers of digital imaging in the world, Eddie brings his teaching experience to bear on issues that other books gloss over or bury under general coverage. Now, you don't have to buy a doorstop-sized book to get the key information you need on color management, efficient workflow, or a variety of other specific digital imaging topics. Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography also covers workflow setup; advanced and professional production techniques; controlling digital color and tone; creative enhancement techniques; and more. This series is a perfect complement to O'Reilly's general list on Photoshop and digital photography, and offers you focused books that cover technical issues at prices that are affordable and solutions that are quickly accessible. We're thrilled that Eddie Tapp has finally agreed to publish books -- and with O'Reilly. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright © 2010 ACM, Inc.

#!Predicting the protein structure from an amino acid sequence is computationally very intensive. In order to speed up protein sequence matching and processing, we present a novel coprocessor architecture for fast protein structure prediction. The architecture consists of systolic arrays to speed up the data intensive sequence alignment and structure prediction steps, and finite state machines for the control dominated steps. The architecture has been synthesized using Synopsys DC Compiler in 0.18 micron CMOS technology and details of its area and timing performance have been provided. A procedure to develop architectures with area-time trade-offs has also been presented.

#!This paper addresses the problem of creating a postmortem identification system by matching image features extracted from dental radiographs. We lay the architecture of a prototype automated dental identification system (ADIS), which tackles the dental image matching problem by first extracting high-level features to expedite retrieval of potential matches and then by low-level image comparison using inherent features of dental images. We propose the use of learnable inherent dental image features for tooth-to-tooth image comparisons. We treat the tooth-to-tooth matching problem as a binary classification problem for which we propose probabilistic models of class-conditional densities. We also propose an adaptive strategic searching technique and use it in conjunction with back propagation in order to estimate system parameters. We present promising experimental results that reflect the value of our approach.

#!Network Management FundamentalsA guide to understanding how network management technology really worksAlexander Clemm, Ph.D.Network management is an essential factor in successfully operating a network. As a company becomes increasingly dependent on networking services, keeping those services running is synonymous with keeping the business running. Network Management Fundamentals provides you with an accessible overview of network management covering management not just of networks themselves but also of services running over those networks.Network Management Fundamentals explains the different technologies that are used in network management and how they relate to each other. The book focuses on fundamental concepts and principles. It provides a solid technical foundation for the practitioner to successfully navigate network management topics and apply those concepts to particular situations.The book is divided into four parts: Part I provides an overview of what network management is about and why it is relevant. It also conveys an informal understanding of the functions, tools, and activities that are associated with it. Part II examines network management from several different angles, culminating in a discussion of how these aspects are combined into management reference models. Part III provides more detail into different building blocks of network management introduced in Part II, such as management protocols, management organization, and management communication patterns.ï¾ Part IV rounds out the book with a number of management topics of general interest, including management integration and service-level management.Dr. Alexander Clemm is a senior architect with Cisco®. He has been involved with integrated management of networked systems and services since 1990. He has provided technical leadership for many leading-edge network management development, architecture, and engineering efforts from original conception to delivery to the customer, and he has also served as technical program co-chair of the 2005 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management. Grasp the business implications of network management Examine different management reference models, such as Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security (FCAPS) Understand the building blocks of network management and their purposes Assess the implications and impact of management technologies and put them in perspective Prepare for decisions about network management that require an understanding of the “big picture”This book is part of the Cisco Press® Fundamentals Series.

#!Anyone who plugs in a Mac whether it's the proud owner of the very latest version or someone still tapping away on yesterday's model usually finds these machines to be an immensely popular and beneficial tool. Unfortunately, they can also be a royal pain in the neck. Any way you slice it, Macs still have a tendency to induce minor headaches at the most inopportune times. Mac Annoyances feels your pain. Developed precisely for the individual who can't live without a Mac yet can't deal with its fickle temperament Mac Annoyances provides solutions to scores of common problems faced by Mac owners. Contained within its pages are hidden (plus well-documented) tips, tricks, and workarounds designed to drastically improve specific problem-solving capabilities. The result: a significant enhancement of the overall user experience and a tremendous savings of time no matter which version you own. What does Mac Annoyances cover? What doesn't it cover is the more appropriate question. Hassles associated with Mac OS X, iLife, Mac hardware, and Microsoft Office (the mother of all annoyances) are all addressed in sharp detail. Also tackled: how to overcome problems related to specific applications such as iTunes, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Apple's Mail program. Having trouble browsing the Web or searching with Google? Want to make your Mac a bit faster? Keyboard causing you trouble? These and dozens more annoyances like them are all dissected as well. Truth is, if you've experienced it, Mac Annoyances addresses it. Written by top-flight author and renowned Mac expert, John Rizzo, this book is a follow-up to the bestselling PC Annoyances. In keeping with the spirit of O'Reilly's Annoyances series, Rizzo adopts a sympathetic tone throughout the book that quickly ingratiates itself to readers. Rather than blaming Mac owners for possessing minimal technical savvy, Mac Annoyances takes them along for a fun-filled ride as they join forces and outsmart the system together.

#index2445
#!Consider a performance measure that is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation where input distributions to the underlying model may involve two stage sampling. The settings of interest include the case where in the first stage physical samples from the distribution are collected. In the second stage, Monte Carlo sampling is done from the observed empirical distribution. We also consider the sampling-importance resampling (SIR) algorithm. Here it is difficult to sample directly from the desired input distribution, and these samples are generated in two stages. In the first stage, a large number of samples are generated from a distribution convenient from the sampling viewpoint. In the second stage, a resampling is done from the samples generated in the first stage so that asymptotically the new samples have the desired distribution. We discuss how to allocate computational and other effort optimally the two stages to minimize the estimator's resultant mean square error.

Our model is the first to capture both identity-dependent and pose-dependent shape variation in a correlated fashion, enabling creation of a variety of virtual human characters with realistic and non-linear body deformations that are customized to the individual. Our learning method is robust to irregular sampling in pose-space and identity-space, and also to missing surface data in the examples. Our synthesized character models are based on standard skinning techniques and can be rendered in real time.

#!“Companies have been implementing large agile projects for a number of years, but the 'stigma' of 'agile only works for small projects' continues to be a frequent barrier for newcomers and a rallying cry for agile critics. What has been missing from the agile literature is a solid, practical book on the specifics of developing large projects in an agile way. Dean Leffingwell's book Scaling Software Agility fills this gap admirably. It offers a practical guide to large project issues such as architecture, requirements development, multi-level release planning, and team organization. Leffingwell's book is a necessary guide for large projects and large organizations making the transition to agile development.” ï¾Jim Highsmith, director, Agile Practice, Cutter Consortium, author of Agile Project Management “There's tension between building software fast and delivering software that lasts, between being ultra-responsive to changes in the market and maintaining a degree of stability. In his latest work, Scaling Software Agility, Dean Leffingwell shows how to achieve a pragmatic balance among these forces. Leffingwell's observations of the problem, his advice on the solution, and his description of the resulting best practices come from experience: he's been there, done that, and has seen what's worked.” ï¾Grady Booch, IBM FellowAgile development practices, while still controversial in some circles, offer undeniable benefits: faster time to market, better responsiveness to changing customer requirements, and higher quality. However, agile practices have been defined and recommended primarily to small teams. In Scaling Software Agility, Dean Leffingwell describes how agile methods can be applied to enterprise-class development. Part I provides an overview of the most common and effective agile methods. Part II describes seven best practices of agility that natively scale to the enterprise level.

#!We present sequential ranking and selection statistical procedures that determine the best simulated model configuration among competing alternatives. The best in this context denotes the largest expected value of a given performance metric. In order to run the procedures efficiently, we give algorithms using batched observations, which under certain conditions, exhibit the characteristics necessary for the appropriate application of ranking and selection procedures. We present empirical results that indicate that the sequential procedures are quite parsimonious, in terms of the number of required observations.

#!While creative professionals spend much of their time working on illustrations, photo-editing, and laying out pages, many parts of their jobs are anything BUT creative. Too often, they spend their time doing repetitive, time-wasting tasks such as placing and replacing images, correcting errors in text, cutting and pasting, and preparing files for printing. Yet virtually every repetitive or time-consuming task that creative professionals have to do in the Adobe Creative Suite can be streamlined with the help of a script. Adobe Bridge is the new navigational center built into Adobe Creative Suite 2 software, giving users instant access to their Adobe Creative Suite project files, applications, and settings. And like all of Adobe Creative Suite 2's components, Adobe Bridge has built-in JavaScript support.Now available in print for the first time, this scripting reference provides the information experienced JavaScript users need to create scripts for Adobe Bridge, whether you're looking to create a custom file browsing view, need to export metadataï¾ from selected thumbnails automatically, or want to create custom navigational bars or dialog boxes that help streamline your company's production workflow. If you're familiar with JavaScript,, C and C++ programming, and the Adobe Creative Suite, this reference will show you how to use the scripting API to extend and manipulate Adobe Bridge.

#!Written by an experienced Active Directory designer and implementor, this book walks you through the concepts of the Active Directory, and the design issues associated with various business environments, outlining strategies, principles and best-practice for creating the design, before leading you through the implementation step-by-step. A well thought-out Active Directory provides a solid foundation for other services which will lower support costs and allow companies to centrally manage their environment. You should look at the Active Directory as your first step in moving to a centrally managed, highly integrated IT environment that supports efficient and effective delivery of business capabilities. Once the appropriate technical infrastructure is in place, it is vital to leverage that infrastructure to create an enterprise-class application infrastructure.While the basics of the Active Directory are straightforward, to get the most from it requires careful planning and a thorough understanding of what can be accomplished. For any environment there are a number of core stages in the Active Directory implementation; the 3 Ds: discovery, design, and deployment. In this unique book, we take a broad range of environment types and work through these stages; suggesting an Active Directory design specific to that environment, and how to implement it; at each stage providing clear instructions so the decisions are clearly understood and the best-practice principles will be maintained throughout your system's lifetime. There are many books on using, administering, or even deploying Active Directory, but this is the only book that exists to relate the crucial design aspects to your target environment, and show you to implement this design.This book covers discovery, design and deployment stages of Active Directory implementation in the following scenarios:· A small, single location company with fairly basic needs and a basic Windows NT 4.0 domain· A larger company with multiple regional areas which are currently facilitated by multiple NT 4.0 domains· A retail-type business with very different drivers and requirements from that of a standard business, based on Windows 2000 Active Directory· Merging and restructuring the Active Directory infrastructure of two financial institutionsThis book is for Windows network administrators, analysts, or architects, with a grasp of the basic operations of Active Directory, and are looking for a book that goes beyond rudimentary operations. However, all of the concepts are explained from the ground up, and the book can be read by network design and administration professionals with no prior Active Directory knowledge.

#*Simulating multiplexed SNP discovery rates using base-specific cleavage and mass spectrometry
#@Sebastian Böcker

#cBioinformatics
#index2479
#!Motivation: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are believed to contribute strongly to the genetic variability in living beings, and SNP and mutation discovery are of great interest in today's Life Sciences. A comparatively new method to discover such polymorphisms is based on base-specific cleavage, where resulting cleavage products are analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). One particular advantage of this method is the possibility of multiplexing the biochemical reactions, i.e. examining multiple genomic regions in parallel. Simulations can help estimating the performance of a method for polymorphism discovery, and allow us to evaluate the influence of method parameters on the discovery rate, and also to investigate whether the method is well suited for a certain genomic region. Results: We show how to efficiently conduct such simulations for polymorphism discovery using base-specific cleavage and MS. Simulating multiplexed polymorphism discovery leads us to the problem of uniformly drawing a multiplex. Given a multiset of natural numbers we want to uniformly draw a subset of fixed cardinality so that the elements sum up to some fixed total length. We show how to enumerate multiplex layouts using dynamic programming, which allows us to uniformly draw a multiplex. Contact: boecker@minet.uni-jena.de

#!In this paper we compute distances with neighbourhood sequences in the cubic and in the triangular grids. First we give a formula which computes the distance with arbitrary neighbourhood sequence in the three-dimensional digital space. After this, using the injection of the triangular grid to the cubic grid, we modify the formula for Z^3 to the triangular plane. The distances in the triangular grid have some properties which are not present on the square and cubic grids. It may be non-symmetric, and it is possible that the distance depends on the ordering of elements of the initial part of the neighbourhood sequence. The distance depends on the ordering of the initial part (up to the kth element) of the neighbourhood sequence if and only if there is a permutation of these elements such that the distance (up to value k) is non-symmetric using the elements in this new order. This dependence means somehow more flexibility of the distances based on neighbourhood sequences on the triangular grid than in Z^n.

#!In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm with silhouette statistics as discriminant function (GASS) for gene selection and pattern recognition. The proposed method evaluates gene expression patterns for discriminating heterogeneous cancers. Distance metrics and classification rules have also been analyzed to design a GASS with high classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method is compared to previously published methods. Various experimental results show that our method is effective for classifying the NCI60, the GCM and the SRBCTs datasets. Moreover, GASS outperforms other existing methods in both the leave-one-out cross validations and the independent test for novel data.

Web developers of all persuasions have embraced the Ajax suite of technologies (JavaScript, HTTP, XML and more) as a way to implement pages that are faster, livelier and more desktop-like in their behavior. Now Atlas brings the power of Ajax to ASP.NET 2.0 developers with controls, script libraries and server support that delivers engaging results without the pain that writing complex JavaScript can entail. Better yet, Atlas web pages are standards based and even run cross-browser.Programming Atlas is not just another "drag and drop" ASP.NET 2.0 book, but dives into the technologies that make it work. You'll begin with a tour of the technologies most often associated with Ajax, from JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest to JSON and the DOM. With the fundamentals in place, author JavaScript expert Christian Wenz unpacks the Atlas framework and shows you how to put its tools to work. You'll learn to:Understand the architecture of Atlas and the role played by server conrols, such as ScriptManager and UpdatePanelUse core Atlas controls and extenders to build more interactive pages with text fields that autocomplete, user input that is validated, controls that can be dragged and dropped, and much moreBind, display, and update data without causing the entire page to refresh and use the Atlas web services bridge to consume third-party services beyond the domain of your applicationIncorporate Microsoft Virtual Earth into an application, use Atlas with Web Parts, and create a Windows Live GadgetUse Atlas with PHP and explore other non-Microsoft Ajax tools for ASP.NET

#cBiological Cybernetics
#index2498
#!Recent experiments have revealed the existence of neural signatures in the activity of individual cells of the pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) of crustacean. The neural signatures consist of cell-specific spike timings in the bursting activity of the neurons. The role of these intraburst neural fingerprints is still unclear. It has been reported previously that some muscles can reflect small changes in the spike timings of the neurons that innervate them. However, it is unclear to what extent neural signatures contribute to the command message that the muscles receive from the motoneurons. It is also unknown whether the signatures have any functional meaning for the neurons that belong to the same CPG or to other interconnected CPGs. In this paper, we use realistic neural models to study the ability of single cells and small circuits to recognize individual neural signatures. We show that model cells and circuits can respond distinctly to the incoming neural fingerprints in addition to the properties of the slow depolarizing waves. Our results suggest that neural signatures can be a general mechanism of spiking&#x2013;bursting cells to implement multicoding.

#!In this paper we present an effective and flexible real-time video analysis system aiming at a wide range of outdoor surveillance and monitoring scenarios, in which robust detection and tracking objects of interest (pedestrians and/or vehicles) are essential to detecting events and understanding scene changes. The approaches employed address properly the challenges found in typical outdoor scenes such as localised and global lighting changes, variations in object size and views, occlusions, and complex object motion and so on. The contributions include use of an effective two-layer shadow removal scheme based on brightness distortion in different colour channels, blob-based object tracking and occlusion handling via multi-state transition management. The system works equally well on highly compressed (JPEG+MPEG-4) video streams as well as raw video data; in the former case, it achieves about 18 frames per second with software MPEG-4 decoder in a modern PC. And the real-time constraint renders most complex tracking algorithms less attractive.

#!Signature-based network intrusion-detection systems (NIDSs) often report a massive number of simple alerts of low-level security-related events. Many of these alerts are logically involved in a single multi-stage intrusion incident and a security officer often wants to analyze the complete incident instead of each individual simple alert. This paper proposes a well-structured model that abstracts the logical relation between the alerts in order to support automatic correlation of those alerts involved in the same intrusion. The basic building block of the model is a logical formula called a capability. We use capability to abstract consistently and precisely all levels of accesses obtained by the attacker in each step of a multistage intrusion. We then derive inference rules to define logical relations between different capabilities. Based on the model and the inference rules, we have developed several novel alert correlation algorithms and implemented a prototype alert correlator. The experimental results of the correlator using several intrusion datasets demonstrate that the approach is effective in both alert fusion and alert correlation and has the ability to correlate alerts of complex multistage intrusions. In several instances, the alert correlator successfully correlated more than two thousand Snort alerts involved in massive scanning incidents. It also helped us find two multistage intrusions that were missed in auditing by the security officers.

#!Distributed systems are hard to build, profile, debug, and test. Monitoring a distributed system - to detect and analyze bugs, test for regressions, identify fault-tolerance problems or security compromises - can be difficult and error-prone. In this paper we argue that declarative development of distributed systems is well suited to tackle these tasks. We present an application logging, monitoring, and debugging facility that we have built on top of the P2 system, comprising an introspection model, an execution tracing component, and a distributed query processor. We use this facility to demonstrate a range of on-line distributed diagnosis tools that range from simple, local state assertions to sophisticated global property detectors on consistent snapshots. These tools are small, simple, and can be deployed piecemeal on-line at any point during a system's life cycle. Our evaluation suggests that the overhead of our approach to improving and monitoring running distributed systems continuously is well in tune with its benefits.

#!Certificateless cryptography involves a Key Generation Center (KGC) which issues a partial key to a user and the user also independently generates an additional public/secret key pair in such a way that the KGC who knows only the partial key but not the additional secret key is not able to do any cryptographic operation on behalf of the user; and a third party who replaces the public/secret key pair but does not know the partial key cannot do any cryptographic operation as the user either. We call this attack launched by the third party as the key replacement attack. In ACISP 2004, Yum and Lee proposed a generic construction of digital signature schemes under the framework of certificateless cryptography. In this paper, we show that their generic construction is insecure against key replacement attack. In particular, we give some concrete examples to show that the security requirements of some building blocks they specified are insufficient to support some of their security claims. We then propose a modification of their scheme and show its security in a new and simplified security model. We show that our simplified definition and adversarial model not only capture all the distinct features of certificateless signature but are also more versatile when compared with all the comparable ones. We believe that the model itself is of independent interest.A conventional certificateless signature scheme only achieves Girault's Level 2 security. For achieving Level 3 security, that a conventional signature scheme in Public Key Infrastructure does, we propose an extension to our definition of certificateless signature scheme and introduce an additional security model for this extension. We show that our generic construction satisfies Level 3 security after some appropriate and simple modification.

#!In converged mobile broadcast and cellular services, the ability to choose among hundreds of digital broadcast streams and browsing a multitude of IP based content, will necessitate integration of advanced user interfaces capable of personalized service discovery. Next generation mobile terminals should be capable of not only displaying available services in the ESG electronic service guide but dynamically filter the content according to user preferences. This article explores possibilities for personalizing service discovery by matching semantic descriptions of media according to user-centric preferences submitted through the 3G return channel. Architectural design components are identified to filter content based on XML transformation of TV-Anytime metadata and additional elements are proposed to extend the existing data models with rich semantics based on RDF syntax and OWL ontology description logics.

#!Do you spend too much time doing repetitive production tasks such as placing and replacing images, resizing them, dragging them from one document to another, and preparing images for printing instead of being creative? Do you use Adobe Photoshop CS2 and have some experience with scripting? You're in luck. Since Adobe Creative Suite 2 was created with built-in support for scripting, virtually every repetitive or time-consuming task that creative professionals have to do in the Adobe Creative Suite can be streamlined with the help of a script. This book describes how to use JavaScript to manipulate and extend Adobe Photoshop within Adobe Creative Suite 2, and provides reference information for the JavaScript objects, properties, and functions defined by Adobe's applications. Now available in print for the first time, this scripting reference provides the information experienced JavaScript users need to create custom scripts for Photoshop, whether you're looking to automate Camera Raw options and settings, automatically resize and export large batches of images into your page-layout application, or want to automatically add metadata, like a copyright notice, to selected image files. These are just a few examples of how you can use Photoshop CS2's built-in scripting capabilities to save you from hours of repetitive tasks.

#!In this article, we introduce pesudoconstraints, a novel data mining pattern aimed at identifying rare events in databases. At first, we formally define pesudoconstraints using a probabilistic model and provide a statistical test to identify pesudoconstraints in a database. Then, we focus on a specific class of pesudoconstraints, named cycle pesudoconstraints, which often occur in databases. We define cycle pesudoconstraints in the context of the ER model and present an automatic method for detecting cycle pesudoconstraints from a relational database. Finally, we present an experiment to show cycle pesudoconstraints &ldquo;at work&rdquo; on real data.

#!The pressure towards tighter or "seamless" integration of health information systems is a recurring issue with both practical and analytical relevance. It taps into a discourse in the IS literature in general and organisation and management science in particular. Unfortunately, the prevailing perception of integration in the IS literature is as a predominantly technical issue. The CSCW literature, however, is attentive to the socio-technical aspects of integration. Building on this --- but supplemented with recent elaborations in science studies --- we aim at exploring the unintended consequences of information systems integration. A user-led perspective implies emphasising the tailoring to local needs based on in-depth studies of the micro practices. We argue, however, that the condition for such an approach is radically undermined by politically motivated, regional changes towards integration with implicated standardisation. Enforcing order in the form of standards across multiple local settings, seemingly a prerequisite for tight integration, simultaneously produces disorder or additional work in other locations for other users. Empirically, our study is based on a large, ongoing integration effort at the University hospital of Northern Norway, specifically studying work practices and perceptions across multiple laboratories.

#!In the literature, on the numerical solution of nonlinear time dependent partial differential equations, much attention has been paid to numerical processes which have the favourable property of being total variation bounded (TVB). A popular approach to guaranteeing the TVB property consists in demanding that the process has the stronger property of being total variation diminishing (TVD).For Runge-Kutta methods--applied to semi-discrete approximations of partial differential equations--conditions on the time step were established which guarantee the TVD property; see, e.g., [J. Comput. Phys. 77 (1988) 439; Math. Comp. 67 (1998) 73; SIAM Rev. 43 (2001) 89; SIAM J. Numer. Anal. (2002), in press; Higueras, Tech. Report, Universidad Pública de Navarra, 2002; SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 40 (2002) 469]. These conditions were derived under the assumption that the simple explicit Euler time stepping process is TVD.However, for various important semi-discrete approximations, the Euler process is TVB but not TVD--see, e.g., [Math. Comp. 49 (1987) 105; Math. Comp. 52 (1989) 411]. Accordingly, the above stepsize conditions for Runge-Kutta methods are not directly relevant to such approximations, and there is a need for stepsize restrictions with a wider range of applications.In this paper, we propose a general theory yielding stepsize restrictions which cover a larger class of semi-discrete approximations than covered thus far in the literature. In particular, our theory gives stepsize restrictions, for general Runge-Kutta methods, which guarantee total-variation-boundedness in situations where the Euler process is TVB but not TVD.

#!In this article, we consider the problem of testing a linear hypothesis in a multivariate linear regression model which includes the case of testing the equality of mean vectors of several multivariate normal populations with common covariance matrix Σ, the so-called multivariate analysis of variance or MANOVA problem. However, we have fewer observations than the dimension of the random vectors. Two tests are proposed and their asymptotic distributions under the hypothesis as well as under the alternatives are given under some mild conditions. A theoretical comparison of these powers is made.

#!When conducting experiments, the selected quality characteristic should as far as possible be a continuous variable and be easy to measure. Due to the inherent nature of the quality characteristic or the convenience of the measurement technique and cost-effectiveness, the data observed in many experiments are ordered categorical. To analyze ordered categorical data for optimizing factor settings, there are three widely accepted approaches: Taguchi's accumulation analysis, Nair's scoring scheme and Jeng's weighted probability scoring scheme. In this paper, a simpler method named the weighted SN ratio method for analyzing ordered categorical data is introduced. A case study involving optimizing the polysilicon deposition process for minimizing surface defects and achieving the target thickness in a very large-scale integrated circuit can demonstrate the four approaches. Finally, comparative analyses of efficiency for employing the four approaches to optimize factor settings are presented according to simulated experimental data that are normally, Weibull and Gamma distributed. From the results, it is obvious that the weighted SN ratio method has the properties of easy computation and uses one-step optimization to obtain the optimal factor settings. Its efficiency is slightly less than that of the scoring scheme, better than that of the accumulation analysis and the weighted probability-scoring scheme.

We present a context for how the framework can be used through its application on two examples. In addition, we describe the design by examining the major conceptual artifacts within the object-oriented model. The framework is built on a Java Simulation Library (JSL) and permits easy modeling and execution of simulation models. The results and discussion indicate the flexibility and power of modeling with the framework. In addition, we summarize our future research efforts to model complex supply chains.

#!We look at a 1-membrane catalytic P system with evolution rules of the form Ca → Cv or a → v, where C is a catalyst, a is a noncatalyst symbol, and v is a (possibly null) string representing a multiset of noncatalyst symbols. (Note that we are only interested in the multiplicities of the symbols.) A catalytic system (CS) can be regarded as a language acceptor in the following sense. Given an input alphabet Σ consisting of noncatalyst symbols, the system starts with an initial configuration wz, where w is a fixed string of catalysts and noncatalysts not containing any symbol in z, and z = a1n1...aknk for some nonnegative integers n1,..., nk, with (a1,...,ak) ⊆ Σ. At each step, a maximal multiset of rules is nondeterministically selected and applied in parallel to the current configuration to derive the next configuration (note that the next configuration is not unique, in general). The string z is accepted if the system eventually halts.It is known that a 1-membrane CS is universal in the sense that any unary recursively enumerable language can be accepted by a 1-membrane CS (even by purely CSs, i.e., when all rules are of the form Ca → Cv). A CS is said to be deterministic if at each step there is a unique maximally parallel multiset of rules applicable. It has been an open problem whether deterministic systems of this kind are universal. We answer this question negatively. We show that the membership problem for deterministic CSs is decidable. In fact, we show that the Parikh map of the language (⊆a1*...ak*) accepted by any deterministic CS is a simple semilinear set which can be effectively constructed. Since nondeterministic 1-membrane CS acceptors (with two catalysts) are universal, our result gives the first example of a variant of P systems for which the nondeterministic version is universal, but the deterministic version is not.We also show that for a deterministic 1-membrane CS using only rules of type Ca → Cv, the set of reachable configurations from a given initial configuration is an effective semilinear set. The application of rules of type a → v, however, is sufficient to render the reachability set nonsemilinear. Our results generalize to multimembrane deterministic CSs. We also consider deterministic CSs which allow rules to be prioritized and investigate three classes of such systems, depending on how priority in the application of the rules is interpreted. For these three prioritized systems, we obtain contrasting results: two are universal and one only accepts semilinear sets.

#!“Brian Noyes' writing style easily captures your attention as he elaborates on all aspects of data binding in his book. He has a refreshingly clear and crisp delivery as he starts each chapter with a simple tour of each topic, and then leads you into practical concerns for sound practices and extensibility opportunities. Most importantly, as Brian explains approaches to data-binding architecture, patterns of usage, the value of data sets, binding controls and the rest, he always describes how he reaches his recommendations on the topic. This book is perfect for newcomers to .NET 2.0, but also for those that have some experience. Anyone who cares about data in their applications (okay, that should be almost everyone) is guaranteed to learn something new and useful by reading Brian's book.” -Michele Leroux Bustamante, IDesign chief architect, Microsoft regional director, and MVP “Brian has saved me a lot of time. I'm writing The Hitchhiker's Guide to Visual Studio and SQL Server 2005 (7th Edition) and I'm not going to have to cover data binding nearly as deeply because Brian has done it for me. His book gets right to the meat of the subject and makes data binding look easy. I was also pleased to see that the book focuses on the misunderstood and under-applied Windows Forms architecture. It's a must-read for anyone trying to make their application more interactive and to leverage the new Visual Studio 2005 technology. I'm planning to point my readers to this resource when they need an in-depth treatment of data binding.” -William Vaughn, president, Beta V Corporation “Data binding has finally come of age in Windows applications. Back in the Visual Studio 6.0 days, I ignored data binding completely and wrote my own repetitive code to encapsulate my business logic. With Visual Studio 2005, we finally have a robust and compelling data-binding technology. To ignore it today would make you inefficient and put you behind the curve. Brian delivers a clear and concise discussion of a core topic of development for Windows today. A combination of an easy-to-follow conversational yet technical tone, excellent examples, and solid explanations make this a must-read for any developer writing for Windows or learning to write for Windows.” -Stephen Forte, chief technical officer, Corzen Inc. “This book provides a clear, readable, and in-depth treatment of data binding, with detailed discussions of best practices in the presentation and use of data. Brian communicates his knowledge on the mechanics of data binding to give the low-level understanding that makes all the difference when building sophisticated applications and troubleshooting difficult problems. Effective data binding can enormously reduce the amount of code in your applications and will allow new levels of sophistication in your development. Read this book.” -Jonathan Cogley, chief executive officer, Thycotic, ASPInsider, and C# MVP “The .NET Framework 2.0, Visual Studio .NET 2005, and Windows Forms 2.0 incorporate the most powerful data-binding platform yet, and absolutely need a book like this to expose it. Brian's extensive data-binding knowledge and experience shine through as he comprehensively explores its many facets, starting with the fundamentals before tackling a wide variety of real-world scenarios. I've always thought a data-binding book was necessary, and I'm glad Brian found the time to write his.” -Michael Weinhardt, freelance author and application developer “Data Binding with Windows Forms 2.0 earns a gold star and a prized place in my development book library. Brian is an exceptional teacher of technology, best practices, and technique. He continues to educate at every presentation I attend; his book carries that quality to paper. I found this book to be highly informative and full of all the important steps and examples necessary to learn this technology. In this book, Brian demonstrates a firm grasp on the concepts and I really enjoy his efforts to promote best practices at every chance. Definitively a cover-to-cover read.” -Randy Hayes, president, Expert Network Solutions, Inc. “Brian's direct and well-organized presentation makes this much misunderstood topic finally understandable.” -Sahil Malik, author of Pro ADO.NET 2.0 and C# MVPData binding is the most important part of many business applications-and one of the most difficult things to understand. Data Binding with Windows Forms 2.0 is the first book to focus on this crucial area of development. It will quickly get you up to speed on binding data sources to Windows Forms components. The book contains clear examples in C# that work with SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005. Visual Basic .NET examples are available on the book's Web site.Brian Noyes, leading consultant and speaker on .NET programming, teaches you both the theory and practice of data binding and provides numerous samples ready to run in Visual Studio 2005.From his in-depth coverage, you'll learn how to Use Visual Studio 2005 to generate a data-bound application from a database Use the new Visual Studio 2005 typed data set designer, and how and why to use typed data sets and typed data adapters Perform simple and complex binding of data to controls, and how to use the .NET 2.0 BindingSource Use the Binding object for simple binding with automatic formatting, and how to handle binding events Generate bound controls with the Visual Studio Designer, and how to use Data Sources Present data with the new DataGridView control, and how to implement advanced features of the DataGridView Implement custom data-bound controls in Windows Forms Create custom business objects and collections that are suitable for use in data binding Implement validation and error handling at the Windows Forms and data-binding levels Implement data binding with ASP.NET 2.0 and the upcoming Windows Presentation Foundation (Avalon) technologies The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!The problem addressed in this paper is the template selection and update in biometrics based on clustering. Template selection is a reliable method to reduce the number of templates used in a biometric system to account for variations observed in a person's biometric data. An efficient method based on clustering with automatic selection of the number of clusters is proposed in this work for finding subgroups of similar templates which are used for prototype selection. Experimental results confirm the advantage of the new method and the importance of adopting a procedure to perform template selection.

#!The paper considers the problem of finding a spanning arborescence on a directed network whose arc costs are partially known. It is assumed that each arc cost can take on values from a known interval defining a possible economic scenario. In this context, the problem of finding the spanning arborescence which better approaches to that of minimum overall cost under each possible scenario is studied. The minimax regret criterion is proposed in order to obtain such a robust solution of the problem. As it is shown, the bounds on the optimal value of the minimax regret optimization problem obtained in a previous paper, can be used here in a Branch and Bound algorithm in order to give an optimal solution. The computational behavior of the algorithm is tested through numerical experiments.

#!This paper presents a new technique of computer-aided analysis and recognition of pathological wrist bone lesions. This method uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and mathematical linguistics allowing to evaluate automatically and analyse the structure of the said bones, based on palm radiological images. Possibilities of computer interpretation of selected images, based on the methodology of automatic medical image understanding, as introduced by the authors, were created owing to the introduction of an original relational description of individual palm (wrist) bones. This description has been built with the use of graph linguistic formalisms already applied in artificial intelligence. These were, however, developed and adjusted to the needs of automatic medical image understanding in earlier works of the authors, as specified in the bibliography section of this paper. The research described in this paper has demonstrated that the for needs of palm (wrist) bone diagnostics, specialist linguistic tools such as expansive graph grammars and EDT-label graphs are particularly well-suited. Defining a graph image language adjusted to the specific features of the scientific problem here-described allowed for a semantic description of correct palm bone structures (with consideration to idiosyncratic features). It also enabled interpretation of images showing some in-born lesions, such as additional bones; or acquired lesions such as their incorrect junctions resulting from injuries and synostoses.

#!This paper proposes a wavelet-domain multiresolution fragile watermarking scheme using an improved quantization-index-modulation (QIM) embedding technique. A secure embedding zone is exploited in our proposed scheme to reduce the false detection rate of Kundur's scheme. The frequency modulated (FM) complex chirp signal is employed as watermark. Both the real and the imaginary parts of the chirp signal are embedded simultaneously in a hierarchical manner. Unlike the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme does not require the original watermark for content integrity verification and quality assessment for the distorted watermarked content. The blind authentication process allows embedding of arbitrary FM chirp watermarks.

Database in Depth: The Relational Model for Practitioners goes beyond the hype and gets to the heart of how relational databases actually work. Ideal for experienced database developers and designers, this concise guide gives you a clear view of the technology--a view that's not influenced by any vendor or product. Featuring an extensive set of exercises, it will help you: understand why and how the relational model is still directly relevant to modern database technology (and will remain so for the foreseeable future)see why and how the SQL standard is seriously deficientuse the best current theoretical knowledge in the design of their databases and database applicationsmake informed decisions in their daily database professional activities Database in Depth will appeal not only to database developers and designers, but also to a diverse field of professionals and academics, including database administrators (DBAs), information modelers, database consultants, and more. Virtually everyone who deals with relational databases should have at least a passing understanding of the fundamentals of working with relational models. Author C.J. Date has been involved with the relational model from its earliest days. An exceptionally clear-thinking writer, Date lays out principle and theory in a manner that is easily understood. Few others can speak as authoritatively the topic of relational databases as Date can.

#!Virtual Environments (VE) allow direct 3D interaction, better perception of shapes and a feel of immersion, properties that are highly desirable for design tasks. Traditional CAD software extensively use WIMP interfaces (Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointing device), but these interaction models are not suited in VE. Moreover, during a design task, the use of dialog boxes, buttons, etc. deteriorates the user's focus on his work. However, to fully benefit from immersive interaction we need more reactive behavior from 3D objects. The objects data structures must provide efficient ways for real-time modification of the geometric definitions of solids via direct 3D interactions. We will present an approach that replaces the traditional editing of the construction history graph in parametric modelers. A description of data structures and algorithms that allow the user to implicitly modify the history of a solid through a direct 3D interaction on topological elements of the objects will be given. The techniques presented here are validated in a VE prototype, using the OpenCASCADE geometric kernel and a multimodal interface.

#!All of Java's Input/Output (I/O) facilities are based on streams, which provide simple ways to read and write data of different types. Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own application. The universe of streams is divided into four large categories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automatically compressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient? Java I/O, 2nd Edition has been updated for Java 5.0 APIs and tells you all you ever need to know about streams--and probably more.A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java supports the Unicode standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting textual and numeric data. Java I/O, 2nd Edition shows you how to control number formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software.Java I/O, 2nd Edition includes:Coverage of all I/O classes and related classesIn-depth coverage of Java's number formatting facilities and its support for international character sets The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!Video temporal segmentation is normally the first and important step for content-based video applications. Many features including the pixel difference, colour histogram, motion, and edge information etc. have been widely used and reported in the literature to detect shot cuts inside videos. Although existing research on shot cut detection is active and extensive, it still remains a challenge to achieve accurate detection of all types of shot boundaries with one single algorithm. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic approach to integrate hybrid features for detecting shot boundaries inside general videos. The fuzzy logic approach contains two processing modes, where one is dedicated to detection of abrupt shot cuts including those short dissolved shots, and the other for detection of gradual shot cuts. These two modes are unified by a mode-selector to decide which mode the scheme should work on in order to achieve the best possible detection performances. By using the publicly available test data set from Carleton University, extensive experiments were carried out and the test results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the representative existing algorithms in terms of the precision and recall rates.

#!OBEX (Object Exchange Protocol) is a session protocol designed to exchange all kind of objects between portable devices using different ad hoc wireless links including IrDA and Bluetooth. This paper develops a mathematical model for OBEX over the IrDA protocol stack by considering multiple applications and presence of bit errors. The model is also verified by simulation results. We derive throughput equations and carry out an optimization study focusing on four major parameters: OBEX packet size, TinyTP (IrDA transport layer) buffer size, IrLAP (IrDA link layer) frame and window size. Equations are derived for the optimum IrLAP windowand frame sizes. Numerical results show significant improvement on OBEX performance using the optimized parameters. The major contribution of this work is the modelling of OBEX including the low layer protocols and optimization of the overall throughput by appropriate parameter selection.

#!Coverage includes- RD White has been DJing for nearly 10 years. He first started in 1995 with a record player, a tape deck and two stereos, matching the beat of a record with the rhythm of a store-bought mix-tape, then mixing the two by adjusting the volume knobs on two stereos. This ghetto method of mixing forced him to learn fast. By the time he could afford real turntables, mixing seemed second nature. In 1997, RD released his first official mix-tape "Skillful Means," made with two turntables, a DJ mixer and two DAT recorders. He laid the main mix down to one DAT player, then played it back through his mixer, recording to another DAT player, and layering more mixing and scratching on top. He used a similar technique in 1999 for the release of his mixï¾CD, "Watering the Timewires," although for this he used an 8-channel ADAT to record multiple layers of mixing, including his own original track mixed in using an Akai MPC-2000. Covers the newest version of this very popular DJ software product, Traktor DJ. Provides a source of good introductory information about a product that's known to have a minimal manual. Offers a pedagogy that is easy-to-follow, with step-by-step instructions and many helpful figures and callouts.

#!In this paper we study the effect of inter organizational information sharing strategies on firm level performance under both stable as well as volatile market conditions. We use information exchange in a supply chain as a representation of inter organizational information sharing, and study five strategies for information sharing that range from minimal to near-complete information exchange. We present analytical evaluation of the relative performance of these strategies and experimental results from a proof-of-concept system. Our results show that near-complete information sharing that combines more than one type of information being shared has better performance in volatile market conditions.

#!This paper describes Princeton University's approach to the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, an off-road race for fully autonomous ground vehicles. The system, Prospect Eleven, takes a simple approach to address the problems posed by the Grand Challenge, including obstacle detection, path planning, and extended operation in harsh environments. Obstacles are detected using stereo vision, and tracked in the time domain to improve accuracy in localization and reduce false positives. The navigation system processes a geometric representation of the world to identify passable regions in the terrain ahead, and the vehicle is controlled to drive through these regions. Performance of the system is evaluated both during the Grand Challenge and in subsequent desert testing. The vehicle completed 9.3 miles of the course on race day, and extensive portions of the 2004 and 2005 Grand Challenge courses in later tests. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!This paper deals with one of the most studied problems in the last few years in the field of wireless communication in ad-hoc networks. The problem consists of reducing the total energy consumption of wireless radio stations distributed over a given area of interest in order to perform the basic pattern of communication by a broadcast. Recently, a tight 6-approximation of the minimum spanning tree heuristic has been proven. While such a bound is theoretically optimal if compared to the known lower bound of 6, there is an obvious gap with practical experimental results. By extensive experiments, proposing a new technique to generate input instances and supported by theoretical results, we show how the approximation ratio can be actually considered close to 4 for a &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; set of instances. We consider, in fact, instances more representative of common practices. Those are usually composed by considerable number of nodes uniformly and randomly distributed inside the area of interest.

Standard string comparison measures perform poorly on this task due to varying transliteration conventions in both languages and the fact that Arabic script does not usually represent short vowels. Significant improvement is achieved by augmenting the classic Levenshtein edit-distance algorithm with character equivalency classes.

#!The sequence step algorithm addresses for the first time the problem of scheduling repetitive projects with probabilistic activity durations while maintaining continuous resource utilization. This algorithm is based on generalized concepts that can be implemented in most general-purpose simulation systems. The algorithm is presented in detail and is applied to an example project with 7 activities and 4 repetitive units using a simulation model developed in Stroboscope, an activity-based simulation system. Numerical and graphical results help explain the algorithm and provide insight into the underlying tradeoff problem between reducing the expected crew idle time and increasing the expected project duration.

#!Stratified Round Robin is a fair-queueing packet scheduler which has good fairness and delay properties, and low quasi-O(1) complexity. It is unique among all other schedulers of comparable complexity in that it provides a single packet delay bound that is independent of the number of flows. Importantly, it is also amenable to a simple hardware implementation, and thus fills a current gap between scheduling algorithms that have provably good performance and those that are feasible and practical to implement in high-speed routers. We present both analytical results and simulations to demonstrate its performance properties.

#!In dielectrics, glasses and networked liquids it is very common to study noise spectra with extended power-law regions to gather useful information. Experimental noise spectra are often characterized by 1/fα regions with different α and other features such as very wide resonances. Because of the overall power-law behavior these spectra are extremely difficult to fit with standard methods. Here I propose a model-based fit procedure that performs well on spectra obtained in a molecular dynamics simulation.

#!Supply chain managers today face an unremitting challenge to their capabilities in both the volume and complexity of factors to be reconciled. In order to achieve more effective decision making, it is very necessary to link strategic objectives to operational actions. However, little is available to guide managers in translating a set of objectives into operations so far. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology to address this gap. In this methodology, strategic objectives are translated into performance metrics by qualitative strategy map and metric network firstly, and then quantitative techniques such as system dynamics simulation and optimization are adopted to take managers through the stages of strategy mapping, action evaluation and decision making. A case study, supported by a software tool, is carried out throughout the paper to illustrate how the method works.

#!We study the denotational semantics of an aspect calculus by compositional translation to a functional language with higher-order store and ML-style references. The calculus is designed to construct only "additive" aspects i.e. those that do not elide the execution of the base computation. Such an aspect calculus is sufficiently expressive to encode before (), after () and around () advice which calls proceed () exactly once. We prove that our translation is adequate i.e. it reflects observational equivalence. Further if a standard object-oriented view of lable is adopted, the translation is fully abstract i.e. it preserves and reflects observational equivalence. A pleasing consequence is that full abstraction of the target-language semantics is thereby inherited by the source-language semantics. This yields the first fully abstract game model for a functional language of additive aspects.

#!Abduction is the process of finding explanations for observed phenomena in accord to known laws about a given application domain. This form of reasoning is an important principle of common-sense reasoning and is particularly relevant in conjunction with nonmonotonic knowledge representation formalisms. In this paper, we deal with a model for abduction in which the domain knowledge is represented in terms of a default theory. We show how the main reasoning tasks associated with this particular form of abduction can be axiomatised within the language of quantified Boolean logic. More specifically, we provide polynomial-time constructible reductions mapping a given abduction problem into a quantified Boolean formula (QBF) such that the satisfying truth assignments to the free variables of the latter determine the solutions of the original problem. Since there are now efficient QBF-solvers available, this reduction technique yields a straightforward method to implement the discussed abduction tasks. We describe a realisation of this approach by appeal to the reasoning system QUIP.

#!Optimal performance in two-alternative, free response decision-making tasks can be achieved by the drift-diffusion model of decision making - which can be implemented in a neural network - as long as the threshold parameter of that model can be adapted to different task conditions. Evidence exists that people seek to maximize reward in such tasks by modulating response thresholds. However, few models have been proposed for threshold adaptation, and none have been implemented using neurally plausible mechanisms. Here we propose a neural network that adapts thresholds in order to maximize reward rate. The model makes predictions regarding optimal performance and provides a benchmark against which actual performance can be compared, as well as testable predictions about the way in which reward rate may be encoded by neural mechanisms.

#!Abstract real-time cloth simulation involves the solution of many computational challenges, particularly in the context of haptic applications, where high frame rates are necessary for obtaining a satisfactory tactile experience. In this paper, we present a real-time cloth simulation system that offers a compromise between a realistic physically-based simulation of fabrics and a haptic application with high requirements in terms of computation speed. We place emphasis on architecture and algorithmic choices for obtaining the best compromise in the context of haptic applications. A first implementation using a haptic device demonstrates the features of the proposed system and leads to the development of new approaches for haptic rendering using the proposed approach.

#!We consider a single machine scheduling problem in which the processing time of a job is a simple linear increasing function of its starting time and the machine is subject to an availability constraint. We consider the non-resumable case. The objectives are to minimize the makespan and the total completion time. We show that both problems are NP-hard and present pseudopolynomial time optimal algorithms to solve them. Furthermore, for the makespan problem, we present an optimal approximation algorithm for the on-line case, and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the off-line case. For the total completion time problem, we provide a heuristic and evaluate its efficiency by computational experiments.

#!Sketch-drawings is an intuitive and comprehensive means of conveying movement ideas in character animation. We proposed a novel sketch-based approach to assisting the authoring and choreographing of Kungfu motions at the early stage of animation creation. Given two human figure sketches corresponding to the initial and closing posture of a Kungfu form, and the trajectory drawings on specific moving joints, MotionMaster can directly rapid-prototype the realistic 3D motion sequence by sketch-based motion retrieval and refinement based on a motion database. The animators can then preview and evaluate the recovered motion sequence from any viewing angles. After the 3D motion sequence has been associated with the 2D sketch drawing, the animator can also interactively and iteratively make changes on the 2D sketch drawing, and the system will automatically transfer the 2D changes to the 3D motion data of current interests. It greatly helps the animator focus on the movement idea development during the evolutionary process of building motion data for articulated characters.

Our computational experience, however, leads us to believe that the method is too costly even for this modest objective.

#!Adjusted Rand index is used to measure diversity in cluster ensembles and a diversity measure is subsequently proposed. Although the measure was found to be related to the quality of the ensemble, this relationship appeared to be non-monotonic. In some cases, ensembles which exhibited a moderate level of diversity gave a more accurate clustering. Based on this, a procedure for building a cluster ensemble of a chosen type is proposed (assuming that an ensemble relies on one or more random parameters): generate a small random population of cluster ensembles, calculate the diversity of each ensemble and select the ensemble corresponding to the median diversity. We demonstrate the advantages of both our measure and procedure on 5 data sets and carry out statistical comparisons involving two diversity measures for cluster ensembles from the recent literature. An experiment with 9 data sets was also carried out to examine how the diversity-based selection procedure fares on ensembles of various sizes. For these experiments the classification accuracy was used as the performance criterion. The results suggest that selection by median diversity is no worse and in some cases is better than building and holding on to one ensemble.

#!A new notion of participation is at stake with advances in technologically mediated work environments. Insufficient bandwidth and insufficiently powerful, crudely coordinated tools resulted in distributed task-based modes of collaboration that did not allow full participation by members of distributed design teams. The emergence of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and User-Controlled Light-Paths (UCLP) herald the beginning of a new age where fully participatory multi-site design may become possible.While most service-oriented solutions are developed for gluing systems or data together, the Participatory Design Studio (PDS) Eucalyptus is developed to manage and configure the resources needed by users engaging in a participatory design session, such as a videoconference application, and a visualization server. Harnessing the power of UCLP, Eucalyptus strives to provide a set of upper layer services for non-technical users to provision devices and applications running on high-speed broadband networks, in addition to conventional TCP/IP networks.

#!System on a chip design results in the integration of digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits on the same substrate which further complicates the already difficult validation problem. This paper presents a new model, labeled hybrid Petri nets (LHPNs), that is developed to be capable of modeling such a heterogeneous set of components. This paper also describes a compiler from VHDL-AMS to LHPNs. To support formal verification, this paper presents an efficient zone-based state space exploration algorithm for LHPNs. This algorithm uses a process known as warping to allow zones to describe continuous variables that may be changing at variable rates. Finally, this paper describes the application of this algorithm to a couple of analog/mixed-signal circuit examples.

#@Ping Yu,Stephen R. Tate

#cProceedings of the 21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops - Volume 01
#index2840
#!We propose an efficient digital signature scheme, which is proved secure under the strong RSA assumption, and can operate in an online/offline manner, doing most of its work in the offline precomputation phase. The online phase, which is performed after the message to be signed is known, is very efficient, requiring only a single modular multiplication. Online/offline signatures are useful in settings in which signatures need to be produced quickly either when there is a large volume of requests or if the device performing the signature is not computationally powerful (such as a mobile device). Our scheme can be seen as an online/offline extension of the traditional signature scheme of Gennaro, Halevi, and Rabin (the GHR signature scheme) which did not operate in this two-phase manner, and required significant computation after the message was known. In contrast to another online/offline extension of the GHR scheme, our new scheme avoids the use of trapdoor hash/commitment primitives, allowing the use of a traditional hash function, improving the efficiency of the offline phase of the algorithm.

#!Considering the analogy between image segmentation and cluster analysis, the aim of this paper is to adapt statistical texture measures to describe the spatial distribution of multidimensional observations. The main idea is to consider the cluster cores as domains characterized by their specific textures in the data space. The distribution of the data points is first described as a multidimensional histogram defined on a multidimensional regular array of sampling points. In order to evaluate locally a multidimensional texture, a co-occurrence matrix is introduced, which characterizes the local distribution of the data points in the multidimensional data space. Several local texture features can be computed from this co-occurrence matrix, which accumulates spatial and statistical information on the data distribution in the neighborhoods of the sampling points. Texture features are selected according to their ability to discriminate different distributions of data points. The sampling points where the local underlying texture is evaluated are categorized into different texture classes. The points assigned to these classes tend to form connected components in the data space, which are considered as the cores of the clusters.

#!This paper presents the design and implementation of a hip range of motion (ROM) estimation method that is capable of fine-grained estimation during total hip replacement (THR) surgery. Our method is based on two acceleration strategies: (1) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for complexity reduction and (2) parallelization for further acceleration. On the assumption that the hip ROM is a single closed region, the AMR strategy reduces the complexity for N × N × N stance configurations from O(N3) to O(ND), where 2 ≤ D ≤ 3 and D is a data-dependent value that can be approximated by 2 in most cases. The parallelization strategy employs the master-worker paradigm with multiple task queues, reducing synchronization between processors with load balancing. The experimental results indicate that the implementation on a cluster of 64 PCs completes estimation of 360 × 360 × 180 stance configurations in 20 seconds, playing a key role in selecting and aligning the optimal combination of artificial joint components during THR surgery.

#!In parallel computing structures, Hypercubes [P. J. Wan, L. W. Liu, Y. Yang, Optimal routing based on the super-topology in Hypercube WDM networks, 1999, pp. 142-149] and [Y. R. Leu, S. Y. Kuo, A fault-tolerant tree communication scheme for hypercube systems, IEEE Trans Comput. 45(6) (1996) 643-650] have many advantages: they support parallel computing, provide disjoint paths, and tolerate faults. If devices with computing capabilities can be linked as a Hypercube by taking advantage of Bluetooth radio's features, then an efficient communication and high-performance computing environment can be established by applying currently used algorithms. A Bluetooth device randomly searches for and connects with other devices, using time-consuming inquiry/inquiry scan and page/page scan operation and hence, results in an uncontrolled scatternet topology and inefficient communications. The present work proposes a three-stage distributed construction protocol for rapidly organizing a Hypercube computing environment that was constructed from Bluetooth devices. The proposed protocol governs the construction of links, the assigning of roles and the formation of the scatternet in order to efficiently construct a Hypercube structure. The constructed scatternet easily enables Bluetooth devices to establish a routing path, tolerate faults and create disjoint paths, and thus, achieves parallel and distributed computing in a Bluetooth wireless environment. Experimental results reveal that the proposed protocol can set up a scatternet that is appropriate for parallel computing and communications.

#!In this paper, we introduce a new technique for the design of high-performance Rayleigh fading channel simulators. The proposed design method uses set partitioning --- a technique, which plays a key role in the design of trellis-coded modulation schemes. We show how set partitioning can be used to design multiple uncorrelated fading waveforms enabling the simulation of Rayleigh fading channels. For the important case of isotropic scattering, we show that the sample average of the generated waveforms results in a deterministic process, the autocorrelation function (ACF) of which tends to the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind as the number of sample functions increases. The proposed procedure is completely deterministic. The comparison with a stochastic procedure using Monte Carlo techniques will be made. A study of the performance shows clearly that the new technique using set partitioning outperforms by far existing Monte Carlo methods.

#!There are two commonly accepted paradigms for organizing intelligence in robotic vehicles, namely, reactive and deliberative. Although these paradigms are well known to researchers, there are few published examples directly comparing their development and application on similar vehicles operating in similar environments. Virginia Tech's participation, with two nearly identical vehicles in the DARPA Grand Challenge, afforded a practical opportunity for such a case study. The two Virginia Tech vehicles, Cliff and Rocky, proved capable of off-road navigation, including road following and obstacle avoidance in complex desert terrain. Under the conditions of our testing, the reactive paradigm developed for Cliff produced smoother paths and proved to be more reliable than the deliberative paradigm developed for Rocky. The deliberative method shows great promise for planning feasible paths through complex environments, but it proved unnecessarily complex for the desert road navigation problem posed by the Grand Challenge. This case study, while limited to two specific software implementations, may help to shed additional light on the tradeoffs and performance of competing approaches to machine intelligence. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!A real-time terrain mapping and estimation algorithm using Gaussian sum elevation densities to model terrain variations in a planar gridded elevation model is presented. A formal probabilistic analysis of each individual sensor measurement allows the modeling of multiple sources of error in a rigorous manner. Measurements are associated to multiple locations in the elevation model using a Gaussian sum conditional density to account for uncertainty in measured elevation as well as uncertainty in the in-plane location of the measurement. The approach is constructed such that terrain estimates and estimation error statistics can be constructed in real-time without maintaining a history of sensor measurements. The algorithm is validated experimentally on the 2005 Cornell University DARPA Grand Challenge ground vehicle, demonstrating accurate and computationally feasible elevation estimates on dense terrain models, as well as estimates of the errors in the terrain model. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!We describe a mixed-initiative framework designed to support the customization of complex graphical user interfaces. The framework uses an innovative form of online GOMS analysis to provide the user with tailored customization suggestions aimed at maximizing the user's performance with the interface. The suggestions are presented non-intrusively, minimizing disruption and allowing the user to maintain full control. The framework has been applied to a general user-productivity application. A formal user evaluation of the system provides encouraging evidence that this mixed-initiative approach is preferred to a purely adaptable alternative and that the system's suggestions help improve task performance.

#!We present a method for articulating and posing meshes, in particular facial meshes, through a 2D sketching interface. Our method establishes an interface between 3D meshes and 2D sketching with the inference of reference and target curves. Reference curves allow for user selection of features on a mesh and their manipulation to match a target curve. Our articulation system uses these curves to specify the deformations of a character rig, forming a coordinate space of mesh poses. Given such a coordinate space, our posing system uses reference and target curves to find the optimal pose of the mesh with respect to the sketch input. We present results demonstrating the efficacy of our method for mesh articulation, mesh posing with articulations generated in both Maya and our sketch-based system, and mesh animation using human features from video. Through our method, we aim to both provide novice-accessible articulation and posing mesh interfaces and rapid prototyping of complex deformations for more experienced users.

#!The sophistication and complexity of analysis performed by today's network intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) benefits greatly from implementation using general-purpose CPUs. Yet the performance of such CPUs increasingly lags behind that necessary to process today's high-rate traffic streams. A key observation, however, is that much of the traffic comprising a high-volume stream can, after some initial analysis, be qualified as "likely uninteresting." To this end, we have developed an in-line, FPGA-based IPS ac-celerator, the Shunt, using the NetFPGA2 platform. The Shunt functions as the forwarding device used by the IPS; it alone processes the bulk of the traffic, offloading the memory bus and leaving the CPU free to inspect the subset of the traffic deemed germane for security analysis. To do so, the Shunt maintains several large state tables indexed by packet header fields, including IP/TCP flags, source and destination IP addresses, and connection tuples. The tables yield decision values the element makes on a packet-by-packet basis: forward the packet, drop it, or divert it through the IPS. By manipulating table entries, the IPS can specify the traffic it wishes to examine, directly block malicious traffic, and "cut through" traffic streams once it has had an opportunity to "vet" them, all on a fine-grained basis. We base our design on a novel series of caches, with a "fail safe" miss policy, coupled to a host PC to handle both cache management and higher level IPS analysis. The design requires only 2 MB of SRAM for its extensive caches, and can sup-port four Gbps Ethernets on a single Virtex 2 Pro 30.

#%478965
#!We present subroutines for the Cholesky factorization of a positive-definite symmetric matrix and for solving corresponding sets of linear equations. They exploit cache memory by using the block hybrid format proposed by the authors in a companion article. The matrix is packed into n(n &plus; 1)/2 real variables, and the speed is usually better than that of the LAPACK algorithm that uses full storage (n2 variables). Included are subroutines for rearranging a matrix whose upper or lower-triangular part is packed by columns to this format and for the inverse rearrangement. Also included is a kernel subroutine that is used for the Cholesky factorization of the diagonal blocks since it is suitable for any positive-definite symmetric matrix that is small enough to be held in cache. We provide a comprehensive test program and simple example programs.

#@D. Steiner,A. Fischer

#%251904

#!Parameterization of 3D meshes is important for many graphics and CAD applications, in particular for texture mapping, re-meshing and morphing. Current parameterization methods for closed manifold genus-n meshes usually involve cutting the mesh according to the object generators, fixing the resulting boundary and then applying the 2D position for each of the mesh vertices on a plane, such that the flattened triangles are not too distorted and do not overlap. Unfortunately, fixing the boundary distorts the resulting parameterization, especially near the boundary. A special case is that of closed manifold genus-1 meshes that have two generators. They can therefore be flattened naturally to a plane without the use of a fixed boundary while still maintaining the continuity of the parameterization. Therefore, in treating genus-1 objects, this attribute must be exploited. This paper introduces a generalized method for planar parameterization of closed manifold genus-1 meshes. As in any planar parameterization with a fixed boundary, weights are assigned over the mesh edges. The type of weights defined depends on the type of mesh characteristics to be preserved. The paper proves that the method satisfies the non-overlapping requirement for any type of positive barycentric weights, including nonsymmetrical weights. Moreover, convergence is guaranteed according to the Gauss-Seidel method. The proposed method is simple to implement, fast and robust. The feasibility of the method will be demonstrated on several complex objects.

#!Simulation and experimentation are two complementary techniques for performance evaluation, each one of them having opposite characteristics and advantages. While one allows total control and abstraction in the experiment, the other provides greater detail and realism. Though ideally it would be desirable to perform both, it is hard to direct the required efforts to develop a performance evaluation twice, once over a simulator and then again on a real network. In this paper a new approach is explored through a tool called Simmcast Testbed, which allows one to execute, from a single codebase, experiments both in simulation and experimentation mode. A didactic example is discussed in detail, and the correlation of the simulated and experimental results is presented.

#!Many industrial verification teams are developing suitable event-sequence languages for hardware verification. Such languages must be expressive, designer friendly, and hardware specific, as well as efficient to verify. While the formal verification community has formal models for assessing the efficiency of an event-sequence language, none of these models also accounts for designer friendliness. We propose an intermediate language for event sequences that addresses both concerns. The language achieves usability through a correlation to timing diagrams; its efficiency arises from its mapping into deterministic weak automata. We present the language, relate it to existing event-sequence languages, and prove its relationship to deterministic weak automata. These results indicate that timing diagrams can become more expressive while remaining more efficient for symbolic model checking than LTL.

#!Previous work has shown that the Cornish-Fisher expansion (CFE) can be used successfully in conjunction with discrete event simulation models of manufacturing systems to estimate cycle-time quantiles. However, the accuracy of the approach degrades when non-FIFO dispatching rules are employed for at least one workstation. This paper suggests a modification to the CFE-only approach which utilizes a power data transformation in conjunction with the CFE. An overview of the suggested approach is given, and results of the implemented approach are presented for a model of a non-volatile memory factory. Cycle-time quantiles for this system are estimated using the CFE with and without the data transformation, and results show a significant accuracy improvement in cycle-time quantile estimation when the transformation is used. Additionally, the technique is shown to be easy to implement, to require very low data storage, and to allow easy estimation of the entire cycle-time cumulative distribution function.

#!During its almost forty years of existence, facial animation has seen a host of technologies being invented, then fading into obsolescence. The modelling and animation methods have mostly been dictated by the available hardware, which greatly evolved through the years. Many animation desiderata that have been considered dreams at the time are now reality while ever new frontiers are encountered and explored. This paper provides an overview of the historically used technologies and attempts to predict the future trends in the field of facial animation as it permeates the entertainment industry with its feature films and computer games; the broad field of visualisation in science, including medical science and forensic analysis; and the fast growing field of information and communication technology and human-computer interaction.

#!We have the technology. This book shows how to make it stronger, faster, better than it was before... For some, buying a new PC is out of the question, so we show how to breathe life back into an older PC. Does that PC really need an upgrade or just a little fixing? This book shows how to make that call without breaking the bank. Why pay to have a PC tech perform simple upgrades?

#!Linear programming (LP) is an area of applied mathematics that is concerned with the minimization (or maximization) of a real-valued linear function on a convex polyhedron. Since the underlying theory is relatively straightforward, the history of the field is dated by the development of algorithms for solving LP problems. Thus the first important contribution was the simplex method developed in 1974 by George Dantzig (4, p. 15). The approach taken by Dantzig was to transform the inequality constraints into a system of equations with sign-restricted variables. This permitted pivoting methods, for solving systems of equations, to be used in linear programming. Thus the simplex method is a set of pivoting rules designed to maximize a linear function constrained by a set of linear equations. Geometrically it can be viewed as an adjacent extreme point method that finds the maximum through an iterative process of implicitly enumerating basic feasible solutions.

A break-in can carry a hefty price: loss of valuable information, tarnishing of the corporate image and brand, service interruption, and hundreds of resource hours of recovery time. Unlike other aspects of information technology, security is adversarial&mdash;it pits IT departments against hackers.

#!In this article, we present logical coordinates based routing (LCR), a novel framework for scalable and location-independent routing in wireless sensor networks. LCR assigns each node a logical coordinate vector, and routes packets following these vectors. We demonstrate that LCR (i) guarantees packet delivery with a high probability, (ii) finds good paths, and (iii) exhibits robust performance in the presence of network voids and node failures. We systematically evaluate the performance of LCR through simulations and compare it with other state-of-the-art protocols. We also propose two extensions of LCR, one for three-dimensional node deployments and the other for unreliable wireless links.
